        <h2>Day 1: Bay Area to Pine Grove</h2>
        <div class="post-date">July 25, 2008</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Dylan met me at my shop in Belmont in the early afternoon, and we ran some errands and took care of some last minute stuff while waiting for Scott to get off work and roll down from SF. Unfortunately, work was insane for Scott and we didn't hit the road until well after 5pm instead of 3:30 or 4pm like we'd hoped. We finally took off across the San Mateo Bridge and up to 580E through Stockton to Hwy 88. We ended up just past Pine Grove, CA around 9pm and found a campsite at Indian Grinding Rock State Historical Park.</p>
            
            <p>After setting up camp, we rolled back down to Pine Grove to see if we could still get dinner at the 88 Giant Burger in town only to find that it had just closed. I rolled in first and asked the kid lingering at the pickup window if the place was still open, to which he replied "no." I asked what else might be open in Pine Grove where we could get a bite to eat and he said "not this place."</p>
            
            <p>I politely explained that I understood that the burger place was closed by this point in the coversation, but that we still needed to eat. With that, he recommended the "hot pocket store" down the street that was open until 11. Of course, "hot pocket store" is white-trash methhead language for "gas station convenience store," so we ended up rolling back down 8 miles into Jackson to another burger joint for mediocre burgers and a $5 pitcher of Bud Light.</p>

        <h2>Day 2: Pine Grove to Boise</h2>
        <div class="post-date">July 26, 2008</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>We didn't want to take 80 via Reno because 395 between Carson City and Reno are nothing but extreme heat, stop-and-go traffic and exhaust fumes. Instead, my route had us taking Hwy 50 from Carson City all the way out to Fallon, but on the fly I decided to cut up to 80 at Fernley, which turned out to be a good idea.</p>
            
            <p>Once we hit the 75mph speed limit on 80, we made very good time to Winnemucca. The ride was straight, flat, and hot as blazes as expected, but at least we were burning miles quickly. Unfortunately, we were also burning daylight quickly and, as we took 95 up into eastern Oregon, we watched the sun quickly setting to our left.</p>
            
            <p>At our next gas stop we had to make a command decision. We had some Hot Springs deeper in Oregon recommended by one friend, and a campground on the border recommended by another, but it was apparent that we weren't going to come close to making either by nightfall, so we opted to ride into the night and just get a motel room outside Boise to make up the time and mileage we lost on Friday night.</p>
            
            <p>We rode well into the night, being as paranoid as possible about animals on the road, and sailing through an absolutely insane monsoon of insects along the Oregon/Idaho border. We stopped for dinner at a Shari's (the only thing that was open) on the outskirts of Boise and I went ahead and made the first potato joke of the week, commenting on how incredibly fresh Shari's waffle-cut fries were.</p>
            
            <p>We ended up settling in at a Motel 6 on the other end of Boise (by the airport) and sleeping like logs.</p>

        <h2>Day 3: Boise to Craters of the Moon</h2>
        <div class="post-date">July 27, 2008</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>We stopped for lunch in Stanley, Idaho and got horrible service from a very personable waiter. Dylan and I got our food finally, but Scott's club sandwich sat on the counter for a good ten minutes while he watched us eat. Eventually, I got up and told another waitress I was going to take the food so we could eat and get out of dodge.</p>
            
            <p>Getting geared up to leave, we spoke to a husband and wife touring on an FZ1 and SV650 respectively, as well as our first of many groups of helmetless riders on their way to Sturgis. Everyone was extremely friendly no matter what type of ride they were on.</p>
            
            <p>The cruise south from Stanley was mostly flat farmland, and not nearly as interesting as I expected. We stopped in Sun Valley for gas and a rest, and eventually ended up at Craters on the Moon National Park before sunset. We acquired our campsite and set up our tents, then Scott and I flew into the nearest town (Arco, ID) for beer and snacks while Dylan finished setting up camp and explored a couple of the volcanic caves in the park.</p>
            
            <p>Night fell, but the moon didn't come up until well into the wee hours of the morning. We passed a few hours drinking and playing dominoes while listning to Patton Oswalt and David Cross albums on my iPod. I won with 300 points, Dylan had 205 and Scott took (it) up the rear with 190.</p>

        <h2>Day 4: Craters of the Moon to Salmon Lake</h2>
        <div class="post-date">July 28, 2008</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Before hitting the road, we decided to take some time riding around the park and exploring a few of the cool volcanic formations. We spent a while looking through some of the lava cones, and Scott and Dylan hiked to the top of one of the huge hills of black rock.</p>
            
            <p>On the way out, I asked the ranger at the gate about taking Hwy 93 up through eastern Idaho instead of taking I-15 up into Montana. He confirmed that 93 was more scenic, and told us it followed the Salmon River. From past experience, all three of us knew that any road that follows a river or creek is generally good, so we went with the new route.</p>
            
            <p>The first leg of 93 was flat and boring as expected--we were still in the (relative) agricultural lowlands of southern Idaho, but we had mountains in front of us and were looking forward to riding in them. We stopped for lunch in Challis, ID where our paper map said the scenic part of the road started. As promised, 93 from then on was beautiful. The roads were in excellent shape, and there was almost no one on the road. We hauled some fairly respectable ass.</p>
            
            <p>Once we crossed the border the speed limits went up significantly (yay, Montana) and so did our pace. With the glorious Montana speed limits, we were also met with a metric ton of road construction, including quite a few stretches of nasty oiled gravel. We made good time between constructions zones, but were often held up for 10-15 minutes a pop when we hit another work site, and then a lot more time cruising over the gravel at 5mph.</p>
            
            <p>We cruised into Missoula, MT at dusk and stopped at the Walmart for some supplies, then decided to cut out to 93 via Hwy 200 and look for camping at Salmon Lake or Placid Lake. We ended up settling in at Salmon Lake, which had running water, hot showers and a firewood dispenser that resembled a gigantic, wooden coke machine. We put in 16 quarters and got a dry bundle of tiny logs that weighed about 3 ounces. Unfortunately, it took us four $4 bundles of balsa to realize that a neighboring (empty) campsite had a pile of huge, heavy logs that would probably burn all night, but we pilfered a few of them anyway to keep the fire going.</p>
            
            <p>Most campsites have an entry fee that covers 1 vehicle, and an additional vehicle fee for extra cars. Salmon Lake was $15 for the site, and appeared to be an additional $5 for <em>every</em> vehicle. Like we did at the campsite in Pine Grove, CA, we put cash for the site and 1.5 cars (6 wheels/3 bikes) in the self-pay envelope and waited to see if a ranger would hassle us in the morning. I was the first one up the next morning and, sure enough, a ranger rolled up like clockwork to (presumably) give us grief for not paying for 3 full vehicles. Instead, the ranger walked right up to me, handed me $8 back, and told me that the camp fee included all our vehicles. Gotta love Montana.</p>
