            <column name="post_content">Dylan met me at my shop in Belmont in the early afternoon, and we ran some errands and took care of some last minute stuff while waiting for Scott to get off work and roll down from SF. Unfortunately, work was insane for Scott and we didnâ€™t hit the road until well after 5pm instead of 3:30 or 4pm like weâ€™d hoped. We finally took off across the San Mateo Bridge and up to 580E through Stockton to Hwy 88. We ended up just past Pine Grove, CA around 9pm and found a campsite at Indian Grinding Rock State Historical Park.

After setting up camp, we rolled back down to Pine Grove to see if we could still get dinner at the 88 Giant Burger in town only to find that it had just closed. I rolled in first and asked the kid lingering at the pickup window if the place was still open, to which he replied â€œno.â€ I asked what else might be open in Pine Grove where we could get a bite to eat and he said â€œnot this place.â€

I politely explained that I understood that the burger place was closed by this point in the coversation, but that we still needed to eat. With that, he recommended the â€œhot pocket storeâ€ down the street that was open until 11. Of course, â€œhot pocket storeâ€ is white-trash methhead language for â€œgas station convenience store,â€ so we ended up rolling back down 8 miles into Jackson to another burger joint for mediocre burgers and a $5 pitcher of Bud Light.

            <column name="post_content">Dylan met me at my shop in Belmont in the early afternoon, and we ran some errands and took care of some last minute stuff while waiting for Scott to get off work and roll down from SF. Unfortunately, work was insane for Scott and we didnâ€™t hit the road until well after 5pm instead of 3:30 or 4pm like weâ€™d hoped. We finally took off across the San Mateo Bridge and up to 580E through Stockton to Hwy 88. We ended up just past Pine Grove, CA around 9pm and found a campsite at Indian Grinding Rock State Historical Park.

After setting up camp, we rolled back down to Pine Grove to see if we could still get dinner at the 88 Giant Burger in town only to find that it had just closed. I rolled in first and asked the kid lingering at the pickup window if the place was still open, to which he replied â€œno.â€ I asked what else might be open in Pine Grove where we could get a bite to eat and he said â€œnot this place.â€

I politely explained that I understood that the burger place was closed by this point in the coversation, but that we still needed to eat. With that, he recommended the â€œhot pocket storeâ€ down the street that was open until 11. Of course, â€œhot pocket storeâ€ is white-trash methhead language for â€œgas station convenience store,â€ so we ended up rolling back down 8 miles into Jackson to another burger joint for mediocre burgers and a $5 pitcher of Bud Light.

            <column name="post_content">In the morning, we rolled out of our Grinding Rock campsite and up Hwy 88 over Carson Pass, stopping for lunch in Kirkwood along the way. After lunch we rolled over the pass and down into Nevada, stopping for gas and refreshments outside Carson City, and taking a picture of the enormous moth that would be a harbinger of the insect storm to come.

We didnâ€™t want to take 80 via Reno because 395 between Carson City and Reno are nothing but extreme heat, stop-and-go traffic and exhaust fumes. Instead, my route had us taking Hwy 50 from Carson City all the way out to Fallon, but on the fly I decided to cut up to 80 at Fernley, which turned out to be a good idea.

Once we hit the 75mph speed limit on 80, we made very good time to Winnemucca. The ride was straight, flat, and hot as blazes as expected, but at least we were burning miles quickly. Unfortunately, we were also burning daylight quickly and, as we took 95 up into eastern Oregon, we watched the sun quickly setting to our left.

At our next gas stop we had to make a command decision. We had some Hot Springs deeper in Oregon recommended by one friend, and a campground on the border recommended by another, but it was apparent that we weren't going to come close to making either by nightfall, so we opted to ride into the night and just get a motel room outside Boise to make up the time and mileage we lost on Friday night.

We rode well into the night, being as paranoid as possible about animals on the road, and sailing through an absolutely insane monsoon of insects along the Oregon/Idaho border. We stopped for dinner at a Shari's (the only thing that was open) on the outskirts of Boise and I went ahead and made the first potato joke of the week, commenting on how incredibly fresh Shari's waffle-cut fries were.

We ended up settling in at a Motel 6 on the other end of Boise (by the airport) and sleeping like logs.

            <column name="post_content">In the morning, we rolled out of our Grinding Rock campsite and up Hwy 88 over Carson Pass, stopping for lunch in Kirkwood along the way. After lunch we rolled over the pass and down into Nevada, stopping for gas and refreshments outside Carson City, and taking a picture of the enormous moth that would be an omen for the insect storm to come.

My route had us taking Hwy 50 from Carson City all the way out to Fallon, but on the fly I decided to cut up to 80 at Fernley, which turned out to be a good idea. We didnâ€™t want to take 80 via Reno because 395 between Carson City and Reno are nothing but extreme heat, stop-and-go traffic and exhaust fumes.

Once we hit the 75mph speed limit on 80, we made very good time to Winnemucca, but we were still burning daylight quickly. We took 95 up into eastern Oregon and watched the sun setting to our left. At our next gas stop we had to make a command decision. We had some Hot Springs deeper in Oregon recommended by one friend, and a campground on the border recommended by another, but it was apparent that we weren't going to come close to making either by nightfall, so we opted to ride into the night and just get a motel room outside Boise to make up the time and mileage we lost on Friday night.

After lunch we rolled over the pass and down into Nevada, stopping for gas and refreshments outside Carson City, and taking a picture of the enormous moth that would be an omen for the insect storm to come.

We didnâ€™t want to take 80 via Reno because 395 between Carson City and Reno are nothing but extreme heat, stop-and-go traffic and exhaust fumes. Instead, my route had us taking Hwy 50 from Carson City all the way out to Fallon, but on the fly I decided to cut up to 80 at Fernley, which turned out to be a good idea.

Once we hit the 75mph speed limit on 80, we made very good time to Winnemucca. The ride was straight, flat, and hot as blazes as expected, but at least we were burning miles quickly. Unfortunately, we were also burning daylight quickly and, as we took 95 up into eastern Oregon, we watched the sun quickly setting to our left.

At our next gas stop we had to make a command decision. We had some Hot Springs deeper in Oregon recommended by one friend, and a campground on the border recommended by another, but it was apparent that we weren't going to come close to making either by nightfall, so we opted to ride into the night and just get a motel room outside Boise to make up the time and mileage we lost on Friday night.

We rode well into the night, being as paranoid as possible about animals on the road, and sailing through an absolutely insane monsoon of insects along the Oregon/Idaho border. We stopped for dinner at a Shari's (the only thing that was open) on the outskirts of Boise and I went ahead and made the first potato joke of the week, commenting on how incredibly fresh Shari's waffle-cut fries were.

We ended up settling in at a Motel 6 on the other end of Boise (by the airport) and sleeping like logs.

            <column name="post_content">We packed up our bikes in the Motel 6 parking lot and hit the road toward the Sawtooth Mountains. The ride up was beautiful and twisty, and the roads were fairly smooth and well maintained. There were plenty of cars and bikes on the road, but we weren't really held back and had plenty of opportunities to pass for the most part.

We stopped for lunch in Stanley, Idaho and got horrible service from a very personable waiter. Dylan and I got our food finally, but Scott's club sandwich sat on the counter for a good ten minutes while he watched us eat. Eventually, I got up and told another waitress I was going to take the food so we could eat and get out of dodge.

Getting geared up to leave, we spoke to a husband and wife touring on an FZ1 and SV650 respectively, as well as our first of many groups of helmetless riders on their way to Sturgis. Everyone was extremely friendly no matter what type of ride they were on.

The cruise south from Stanley was mostly flat farmland, and not nearly as interesting as I expected. We stopped in Sun Valley for gas and a rest, and eventually ended up at Craters on the Moon National Park before sunset. We acquired our campsite and set up our tents, then Scott and I flew into the nearest town (Arco, ID) for beer and snacks while Dylan finished setting up camp and explored a couple of the volcanic caves in the park.

Night fell, but the moon didn't come up until well into the wee hours of the morning. We passed a few hours drinking and playing dominoes while listning to Patton Oswalt and David Cross albums on my iPod. I won with 300 points, Dylan had 205 and Scott took (it) up the rear with 190.

            <column name="post_content">We woke up and packed up camp under the already-sweltering sun, without a lick of shade for 100 miles in any direction.

Before hitting the road, we decided to take some time riding around the park and exploring a few of the cool volcanic formations. We spent a bit of time looking through some of the lava cones, and Scott and Dylan hiked to the top of one of the huge hills of black rock. I was profoundly lazy and hid under the shade of a parked RV rather than hiking up a hill in the sun wearing 50 lbs. of black leather.

On the way out of the park, we asked the ranger at the gate about taking Hwy 93 up through eastern Idaho instead of taking I-15 up into Montana. He confirmed that 93 was more scenic, and told us it followed the Salmon River. From past experience, the three of us knew that any road that follows a river or creek is generally good, so we went with the new route.

The first leg of 93 was flat and boring as expected--we were still in the agricultural (relative) lowlands of southern Idaho, but we had mountains in front of us and were looking forward to riding in them. We stopped for a ridiculously large lunch in Challis, ID where our AAA map said the scenic part of the road started. As promised, 93 from then on was beautiful. The roads were in excellent shape, and there was almost no one on the road. We hauled some fairly respectable ass.

Once we crossed the border the speed limits went up significantly and so did our pace. With the glorious Montana speed limits, we were also met with a veritable ton of road construction, including quite a few stretches of nasty oiled gravel. We made good time between constructions zones, but were often held up for 10-15 minutes a pop when we hit another work site, and then a lot more time cruising over the gravel at 5mph.

We cruised into Missoula, MT at dusk and stopped at the Walmart for some supplies, then decided to cut out to 93 via Hwy 200 and look for camping at Salmon Lake or Placid Lake. We ended up settling in at Salmon Lake, which had running water, hot showers and a firewood dispenser that resembled a gigantic, wooden coke machine. We put in 16 quarters and got a dry bundle of tiny logs that weighed about 3 ounces. Unfortunately, it took us four $4 bundles of balsa to realize that a neighboring (empty) campsite had a pile of huge, heavy logs that would probably burn all night, but we pilfered a few of them anyway to keep the fire going.

Most campsites have an entry fee that covers 1 vehicle, and an additional vehicle fee for extra cars. Salmon Lake was $15 for the site, and appeared to be an additional $5 for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; vehicle. Like we did at the campsite in Pine Grove, CA, we put cash for the site and 1.5 cars (6 wheels/3 bikes) in the self-pay envelope and waited to see if a ranger would hassle us in the morning. I was the first one up the next morning and, sure enough, a ranger rolled up like clockwork to (presumably) give us grief for not paying for 3 full vehicles. Instead, the ranger walked right up to me, handed me $8 back, and told me that the camp fee included all our vehicles. Gotta love Montana.

            <column name="post_content">We packed up our bikes in the Motel 6 parking lot and hit the road toward the Sawtooth Mountains. The ride up was beautiful and twisty, and the roads were fairly smooth and well maintained. There were plenty of cars and bikes on the road, but we weren't really held back and had plenty of opportunities to pass for the most part.

We stopped for lunch in Stanley, Idaho and got horrible service from a very personable waiter. Dylan and I got our food finally, but Scott's club sandwich sat on the counter for a good ten minutes while he watched us eat. Eventually, I got up and told another waitress I was going to take the food so we could eat and get out of dodge.

Getting geared up to leave, we spoke to a husband and wife touring on an FZ1 and SV650 respectively, as well as our first of many groups of helmetless riders on their way to Sturgis. Everyone was extremely friendly no matter what type of ride they were on.

The cruise south from Stanley was mostly flat farmland, and not nearly as interesting as I expected. We stopped in Sun Valley for gas and a rest, and eventually ended up at Craters on the Moon National Park before sunset. We acquired our campsite and set up our tents, then Scott and I flew into the nearest town (Arco, ID) for beer and snacks while Dylan finished setting up camp and explored a couple of the volcanic caves in the park.

Night fell, but the moon didn't come up until well into the wee hours of the morning. We passed a few hours drinking and playing dominoes while listning to Patton Oswalt and David Cross albums on my iPod. I won with 300 points, Dylan had 205 and Scott took (it) up the rear with 190.

            <column name="post_content">We woke up and packed up camp under the already-sweltering sun.

Before hitting the road, we decided to take some time riding around the park and exploring a few of the cool volcanic formations. We spent a while looking through some of the lava cones, and Scott and Dylan hiked to the top of one of the huge hills of black rock.

On the way out, I asked the ranger at the gate about taking Hwy 93 up through eastern Idaho instead of taking I-15 up into Montana. He confirmed that 93 was more scenic, and told us it followed the Salmon River. From past experience, all three of us knew that any road that follows a river or creek is generally good, so we went with the new route.

The first leg of 93 was flat and boring as expected--we were still in the (relative) agricultural lowlands of southern Idaho, but we had mountains in front of us and were looking forward to riding in them. We stopped for lunch in Challis, ID where our paper map said the scenic part of the road started. As promised, 93 from then on was beautiful. The roads were in excellent shape, and there was almost no one on the road. We hauled some fairly respectable ass.

Once we crossed the border the speed limits went up significantly (yay, Montana) and so did our pace. We cruised into Missoula, MT at dusk and stopped at the Walmart for some supplies, then decided to cut out to 93 via Hwy 200 and look for camping at Salmon Lake or Placid Lake.

We ended up settling in at Salmon Lake, which had running water, hot showers and a firewood dispenser that resembled a giant coke machine. We put in 16 quarters and got a dry bundle of wood that weighed about 3 oz. Unfortunately, it took us four bundles to realize that a neighboring (empty) campsite had a pile of huge, heavy logs that would probably burn all night, but we pilfered a few of them anyway to keep the fire going.

Most campsites have an entry fee that covers 1 vehicle, and an additional vehicle fee for extra cars. Salmon Lake was $15 for the site, and appeared to be an additional $5 for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; vehicle. Like we did at the campsite in Pine Grove, CA, we put cash for the site and 1.5 cars (6 wheels/3 bikes) in the self-pay envelope and waited to see if a ranger would hassle us in the morning.

I was the first one up the next morning and, sure enough, a ranger rolled up like clockwork to (presumably) hassle us for not paying for 3 full vehicles. Instead, the ranger walked right up to me, handed me $8 back, and told us that the camp fee included our vehicles. Gotta love Montana.

The roads were in excellent shape, and there was almost no one on the road. We hauled some fairly respectable ass.

Once we crossed the border the speed limits went up significantly and so did our pace. With the glorious Montana speed limits, we were also met with a metric ton of road construction, including quite a few stretches of nasty oiled gravel. We made good time between constructions zones, but were often held up for 10-15 minutes a pop when we hit another work site, and then a lot more time cruising over the gravel at 5mph.

We cruised into Missoula, MT at dusk and stopped at the Walmart for some supplies, then decided to cut out to 93 via Hwy 200 and look for camping at Salmon Lake or Placid Lake. We ended up settling in at Salmon Lake, which had running water, hot showers and a firewood dispenser that resembled a gigantic, wooden coke machine. We put in 16 quarters and got a dry bundle of tiny logs that weighed about 3 ounces. Unfortunately, it took us four $4 bundles of balsa to realize that a neighboring (empty) campsite had a pile of huge, heavy logs that would probably burn all night, but we pilfered a few of them anyway to keep the fire going.

            <column name="post_content">I managed to get up a bit earlier than Deeter and Dylan and pack up all my crap, thinking I'd get a head start and get to relax and enjoy my bottle of Starbucks Dark Mocha Frapachino(tm) while they did their packing. Unfortunately, as I finished loading up my bike and the guys got up, I realized that my iPod was missing and probably rolled up in to my tent

I un-bungeed all the stuff off my bike and rolled out my tent, only to find that it wasn't there. I eventually found it rolled up in my sleeping bag, so I ended up having to repack the TWO biggest pains in the ass of all my gear. Good times.

We left camp sometime after 10am and cruised the rest of the way up 83 to a gas station in Bigfork, MT just outside of Kalispell. Up to this point, we'd been running either far behind or far ahead of schedule nearly every day, and we never had an idea of exactly where we were going to land until the sun started to decend.

Matthew (MeterMan on BARF) had graciously offered crash space at his house in Kalispell, but at this point it looked like we would be rolling through Glacier in a couple of hours and end up far past Kalispell and somewhere down near Lolo by the end of day. I called Matt from Bigfork (just outside Kalispell) around 11:30am hoping to catch lunch with him on the way up to Glacier or possible an early dinner or drinks on the way out in the late afternoon. He had to work until 3:30ish, so it looked like it would be the latter.

We pressed on up toward Glacier and stopped at a diner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=hungry+horse,+mt&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=8&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hungry Horse, MT&lt;/a&gt; (just outside Glacier) for brunch. After some epic pancakes, we pressed on to the gates of the park. Rolling in, Glacier was just as spectacular as I remember it 15+ years ago. We cruised in behind a bunch of RVs and SUVs as expected, and stopped at a river to take a few photos.

When we started climbing up the aptly-named &lt;em&gt;Going to the Sun Road&lt;/em&gt;, it became apparent that there was some heavy road construction going on inside the park too. About halfway up the mountain we hit more gravel roads, but this time steep and winding. I felt pretty hard-core riding a heavy (and heavily loaded) sportbike up this road on gravel, until I saw a couple riding 2-up &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; the mountain on a big ST1300. Evidently, we were pansies.

We stopped several times for pictures on the way up, and a few times at one-lane construction corridors while oncoming traffic was allowed through. At one stop, we met a couple from Oakdale, CA on their way to Sturgis, one of whom was on a crazy customized &quot;Bull Bike&quot; complete with horns, a tail and nards, so of course Dylan got a picture sitting on it. Nice folks.

Because of the construction, it ended up taking all day to get through Glacier, but the park was startlingly beautiful and well worth blowing the whole day. Coming down the backside on Hwy 89 around 6pm, the traffic finally cleared up a bit, and we were booking along at freeway speeds again. The speed limit was 70mph (as it is on most Montana backroads) and I was leading at about 90mph after just passing a car.

By previous Montana construction experience, keen observation, or just by dumb frigging luck, I noticed that the road ahead suddenly got lighter in color, and that there was no center-line anymore. I assumed the worst and braked hard, rolling onto gravel at about 40mph just as I let off the front brake. To add insult to injury, the crew had placed a &quot;Pavement Ends&quot; sign several hundred feet past the start of the gravel. Thanks, guys.

All three bikes stayed up, but we were not happy campers at all, given absolutely no warning before we potentially lost our shit. This construction zone stretched for 10 or 15 miles, and it took us forever to get to Browning (and cell reception) to call Matt again. We were still 100 miles shy of Kalispell and the sun was going down, so I called Matt and took him up on his offer for crash space after all.

We did our best to follow the roads that AAA called &quot;scenic&quot; on their maps (the ones with the little green dots along the road), and avoid the ones that weren't deemed scenic. So far it had worked out fairly well, but Hwy 2 back to Kalispell was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; marked as scenic and turned out to be fantastic. Riding carefully and watching for all the animals that tend to come out at dusk, we cruised back into Kalispell and eventually found Matt's house.

It was pushing 9pm and hot as hell, so we ordered a couple of pizzas and started to decimate the case of cold &lt;a href=&quot;http://kokaneebeer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kokanee&lt;/a&gt; in Matt's fridge. It became quickly apparent that 12 bottles wasn't going to do the job, and that we were drinking him out of house and home. Matt and I made a quick trip to the local Hot Pocket Store(tm) for a couple more cases, and the rest of the evening was spent eating, drinking, and conversating over a thousand beers. Excellent times, and just what we needed.

            <column name="post_content">We woke up and packed up camp under the already-sweltering sun.

Before hitting the road, we decided to take some time riding around the park and exploring a few of the cool volcanic formations. We spent a while looking through some of the lava cones, and Scott and Dylan hiked to the top of one of the huge hills of black rock.

On the way out, I asked the ranger at the gate about taking Hwy 93 up through eastern Idaho instead of taking I-15 up into Montana. He confirmed that 93 was more scenic, and told us it followed the Salmon River. From past experience, all three of us knew that any road that follows a river or creek is generally good, so we went with the new route.

The first leg of 93 was flat and boring as expected--we were still in the (relative) agricultural lowlands of southern Idaho, but we had mountains in front of us and were looking forward to riding in them. We stopped for lunch in Challis, ID where our paper map said the scenic part of the road started. As promised, 93 from then on was beautiful. The roads were in excellent shape, and there was almost no one on the road. We hauled some fairly respectable ass.

Once we crossed the border the speed limits went up significantly and so did our pace. With the glorious Montana speed limits, we were also met with a metric ton of road construction, including quite a few stretches of nasty oiled gravel. We made good time between constructions zones, but were often held up for 10-15 minutes a pop when we hit another work site, and then a lot more time cruising over the gravel at 5mph.

We cruised into Missoula, MT at dusk and stopped at the Walmart for some supplies, then decided to cut out to 93 via Hwy 200 and look for camping at Salmon Lake or Placid Lake. We ended up settling in at Salmon Lake, which had running water, hot showers and a firewood dispenser that resembled a gigantic, wooden coke machine. We put in 16 quarters and got a dry bundle of tiny logs that weighed about 3 ounces. Unfortunately, it took us four $4 bundles of balsa to realize that a neighboring (empty) campsite had a pile of huge, heavy logs that would probably burn all night, but we pilfered a few of them anyway to keep the fire going.

Most campsites have an entry fee that covers 1 vehicle, and an additional vehicle fee for extra cars. Salmon Lake was $15 for the site, and appeared to be an additional $5 for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; vehicle. Like we did at the campsite in Pine Grove, CA, we put cash for the site and 1.5 cars (6 wheels/3 bikes) in the self-pay envelope and waited to see if a ranger would hassle us in the morning. I was the first one up the next morning and, sure enough, a ranger rolled up like clockwork to (presumably) give us grief for not paying for 3 full vehicles. Instead, the ranger walked right up to me, handed me $8 back, and told me that the camp fee included all our vehicles. Gotta love Montana.

            <column name="post_content">Dylan met me at my shop in Belmont in the afternoon, and we waited for Scott to get off work and roll down from SF. Unfortunately, work was insane for Scott and we didnâ€™t hit the road until well after 5pm instead of 3:30 or 4pm like weâ€™d hoped. We finally took off across the San Mateo Bridge and up to 580E through Stockton to Hwy 88. We ended up just past Pine Grove, CA around 9pm and found a campsite at Indian Grinding Rock State Historical Park.

After setting up camp, we rolled back down to Pine Grove to see if we could still get dinner at the 88 Giant Burger in town only to find that it had just closed. I rolled in first and asked the kid lingering at the pickup window if the place was still open, to which he replied â€œno.â€ I asked what else might be open in Pine Grove where we could get a bite to eat and he said â€œnot this place.â€

I politely explained that I understood that the burger place was closed by this point in the coversation, but that we still needed to eat. With that, he recommended the â€œhot pocket storeâ€ down the street that was open until 11. Of course, â€œhot pocket storeâ€ is white-trash methhead language for â€œgas station convenience store,â€ so we ended up rolling back down 8 miles into Jackson to another burger joint for mediocre burgers and a $5 pitcher of Bud Light.

We ended up just past Pine Grove, CA around 9pm and found a campsite at Indian Grinding Rock State Historical Park.

After setting up camp, we rolled back down to Pine Grove to see if we could still get dinner at the 88 Giant Burger in town only to find that it had just closed. I rolled in first and asked the kid lingering at the pickup window if the place was still open, to which he replied â€œno.â€ I asked what else might be open in Pine Grove where we could get a bite to eat and he said â€œnot this place.â€

I politely explained that I understood that the burger place was closed by this point in the coversation, but that we still needed to eat. With that, he recommended the â€œhot pocket storeâ€ down the street that was open until 11. Of course, â€œhot pocket storeâ€ is white-trash methhead language for â€œgas station convenience store,â€ so we ended up rolling back down 8 miles into Jackson to another burger joint for mediocre burgers and a $5 pitcher of Bud Light.

            <column name="post_content">In the morning, we rolled out of our Grinding Rock campsite and up Hwy 88 over Carson Pass, stopping for lunch in Kirkwood along the way. After lunch we rolled over the pass and down into Nevada, stopping for gas and refreshments outside Carson City, and taking a picture of the enormous moth that would be an omen for the insect storm to come.

My route had us taking Hwy 50 from Carson City all the way out to Fallon, but on the fly I decided to cut up to 80 at Fernley, which turned out to be a good idea. We didnâ€™t want to take 80 via Reno because 395 between Carson City and Reno are nothing but extreme heat, stop-and-go traffic and exhaust fumes.

Once we hit the 75mph speed limit on 80, we made very good time to Winnemucca, but we were still burning daylight quickly. We took 95 up into eastern Oregon and watched the sun setting to our left. At our next gas stop we had to make a command decision. We had some Hot Springs deeper in Oregon recommended by one friend, and a campground on the border recommended by another, but it was apparent that we weren't going to come close to making either by nightfall, so we opted to ride into the night and just get a motel room outside Boise to make up the time and mileage we lost on Friday night.

            <column name="post_content">We packed up our bikes in the Motel 6 parking lot and hit the road toward the Sawtooth Mountains. The ride up was beautiful and twisty, and the roads were fairly smooth and well maintained. There were plenty of cars and bikes on the road, but we weren't really held back and had plenty of opportunities to pass for the most part.

We stopped for lunch in Stanley, Idaho and got horrible service from a very personable waiter. Dylan and I got our food finally, but Scott's club sandwich sat on the counter for a good ten minutes while he watched us eat. Eventually, I got up and told another waitress I was going to take the food so we could eat and get out of dodge.

Getting geared up to leave, we spoke to a husband and wife touring on an FZ1 and SV650 respectively, as well as our first of many groups of helmetless riders on their way to Sturgis. Everyone was extremely friendly no matter what type of ride they were on.

The cruise south from Stanley was mostly flat farmland, and not nearly as interesting as I expected. We stopped in Sun Valley for gas and a rest, and eventually ended up at Craters on the Moon National Park before sunset. We acquired our campsite and set up our tents, then Scott and I flew into the nearest town (Arco, ID) for beer and snacks while Dylan finished setting up camp and explored a couple of the volcanic caves in the park.

Night fell, but the moon didn't come up until well into the wee hours of the morning. We passed a few hours drinking and playing dominoes while listning to Patton Oswalt and David Cross albums on my iPod. I won with 300 points, Dylan had 205 and Scott took (it) up the rear with 190.

            <column name="post_content">I managed to wake up a bit earlier than Deeter and Dylan to pack up all my crap, thinking I'd get a head start and get to relax and enjoy my bottle of Starbucks Dark Mocha Frapachino(tm) while they did their packing. Unfortunately, as I finished loading up my bike and the guys got up, I realized that my iPod was missing and probably rolled up into my tent

I un-bungeed all the stuff off my bike and rolled out my tent, only to find that it wasn't there. I eventually found it rolled up in my sleeping bag, so I ended up having to repack the TWO biggest pains in the ass of all my gear. Good times.

Up to this point, we'd been running either far behind or far ahead of schedule every day, and never had an idea of exactly where we were going to land. We left camp sometime after 10am and cruised the rest of the way up 83 to a gas station in Bigfork, MT just outside of Kalispell.

Matthew (MeterMan on BARF) had graciously offered crash space at his house in Kalispell, but at this point it looked like we would be rolling through Glacier in a couple of hours and end up far past Kalispell and somewhere down near Lolo by the end of day. I called Matt from Bigfork around 11:30am hoping to catch lunch on the way into Glacier or possible an early dinner or drinks on the way out in the late afternoon. He had to work until 3:30ish, so it looked like it would be the latter.

We pressed on up toward Glacier and stopped at a diner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=hungry+horse,+mt&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=8&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hungry Horse, MT&lt;/a&gt; (just outside Glacier) for brunch. After some epic pancakes, we pressed on to the gates of the park. Rolling in, Glacier was just as spectacular as I remember it 15+ years ago. We cruised in behind a bunch of RVs and SUVs as expected, and stopped at a river to take a few photos.

When we started climbing up the aptly-named Going to the Sun Road, it became apparent that there was some heavy road construction going on inside the park too. About halfway up the mountain we hit more gravel roads, but this time steep and winding. I felt pretty hard-core riding a heavy (and heavily loaded) sportbike up this road on gravel, until I saw a couple riding 2-up &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; the mountain on a big ST1300. Yeah, we were pansies.

We stopped several times for pictures on the way up, and a few times at one-lane construction corridors while oncoming traffic was allowed through. At one stop, we met a couple on their way to Sturgis, one of whom was on a crazy customized &quot;Bull Bike&quot; complete with horns, a tail and nards, so of course Dylan got a picture sitting on it.

Because of the construction, it ended up taking all day to get through Glacier. Coming down the backside on Hwy 89 around 6pm, the traffic finally cleared up, and we were booking along at freeway speeds again. The speed limit was 70mph (as it is on most Montana backroads) and I was leading at about 90mph after just passing a car.

By previous Montana construction experience, keen observation, or just by dumb frigging luck, I noticed that the road ahead suddenly got lighter in color, and that there was no center-line anymore. I assumed the worst and braked hard, rolling onto gravel at about 40mph just as I let off the front brake. To add insult to injury, the crew had placed a &quot;Pavement Ends&quot; sign several hundred feet past the start of the gravel.

All three bikes stayed up, but we were not happy campers at all, given no warning before we potentially lost our shit. This construction zone stretched for 10 or 15 miles, and it took us forever to get to Browning and call Matt again. We were 100 miles shy of Kalispell and the sun was going down, so I called Matt and took him up on his offer for crash space after all.

We did our best to follow the roads that AAA called &quot;scenic&quot; on their maps (the ones with the little green dots along the road), and avoid the ones that weren't deemed scenic. So far it worked out fairly well, but Hwy 2 back to Kalispell was not one of them and it turned out to be awesome. Riding carefully and watching for all the animals that tend to come out at dusk, we cruised back into Kalispell and eventually found Matt's house.

It was pushing 9pm and hot as hell, so we ordered a couple of pizzas and started to decimate the case of cold &lt;a href=&quot;http://kokaneebeer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kokanee&lt;/a&gt; in Matt's fridge. It became quickly apparent that 12 bottles wasn't going to do the job, and that we were drinking him out of house and home. Matt and I made a quick trip to the local Hot Pocket Store(tm) for a couple more cases, and the rest of the evening was spent eating, drinking, and conversating over a thousand beers.

This construction zone stretched for 10 or 15 miles, and it took us forever to get to Browning (and cell reception) to call Matt again. We were still 100 miles shy of Kalispell and the sun was going down, so I called Matt and took him up on his offer for crash space after all.

We did our best to follow the roads that AAA called &quot;scenic&quot; on their maps (the ones with the little green dots along the road), and avoid the ones that weren't deemed scenic. So far it had worked out fairly well, but Hwy 2 back to Kalispell was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; marked as scenic and turned out to be fantastic. Riding carefully and watching for all the animals that tend to come out at dusk, we cruised back into Kalispell and eventually found Matt's house.

It was pushing 9pm and hot as hell, so we ordered a couple of pizzas and started to decimate the case of cold &lt;a href=&quot;http://kokaneebeer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kokanee&lt;/a&gt; in Matt's fridge. It became quickly apparent that 12 bottles wasn't going to do the job, and that we were drinking him out of house and home. Matt and I made a quick trip to the local Hot Pocket Store(tm) for a couple more cases, and the rest of the evening was spent eating, drinking, and conversating over a thousand beers. Excellent times, and just what we needed.

            <column name="post_content">I managed to get up a bit earlier than Deeter and Dylan and pack up all my crap, thinking I'd get a head start and get to relax and enjoy my bottle of Starbucks Dark Mocha Frapachino(tm) while they did their packing. Unfortunately, as I finished loading up my bike and the guys got up, I realized that my iPod was missing and probably rolled up in to my tent

I un-bungeed all the stuff off my bike and rolled out my tent, only to find that it wasn't there. I eventually found it rolled up in my sleeping bag, so I ended up having to repack the TWO biggest pains in the ass of all my gear. Good times.

We left camp sometime after 10am and cruised the rest of the way up 83 to a gas station in Bigfork, MT just outside of Kalispell. Up to this point, we'd been running either far behind or far ahead of schedule nearly every day, and we never had an idea of exactly where we were going to land until the sun started to decend.

Matthew (MeterMan on BARF) had graciously offered crash space at his house in Kalispell, but at this point it looked like we would be rolling through Glacier in a couple of hours and end up far past Kalispell and somewhere down near Lolo by the end of day. I called Matt from Bigfork (just outside Kalispell) around 11:30am hoping to catch lunch with him on the way up to Glacier or possible an early dinner or drinks on the way out in the late afternoon. He had to work until 3:30ish, so it looked like it would be the latter.

We pressed on up toward Glacier and stopped at a diner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=hungry+horse,+mt&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=8&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hungry Horse, MT&lt;/a&gt; (just outside Glacier) for brunch. After some epic pancakes, we pressed on to the gates of the park. Rolling in, Glacier was just as spectacular as I remember it 15+ years ago. We cruised in behind a bunch of RVs and SUVs as expected, and stopped at a river to take a few photos.

When we started climbing up the aptly-named &lt;em&gt;Going to the Sun Road&lt;/em&gt;, it became apparent that there was some heavy road construction going on inside the park too. About halfway up the mountain we hit more gravel roads, but this time steep and winding. I felt pretty hard-core riding a heavy (and heavily loaded) sportbike up this road on gravel, until I saw a couple riding 2-up &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; the mountain on a big ST1300. Evidently, we were pansies.

We stopped several times for pictures on the way up, and a few times at one-lane construction corridors while oncoming traffic was allowed through. At one stop, we met a couple from Oakdale, CA on their way to Sturgis, one of whom was on a crazy customized &quot;Bull Bike&quot; complete with horns, a tail and nards, so of course Dylan got a picture sitting on it. Nice folks.

Because of the construction, it ended up taking all day to get through Glacier, but the park was startlingly beautiful and well worth blowing the whole day. Coming down the backside on Hwy 89 around 6pm, the traffic finally cleared up a bit, and we were booking along at freeway speeds again. The speed limit was 70mph (as it is on most Montana backroads) and I was leading at about 90mph after just passing a car.

By previous Montana construction experience, keen observation, or just by dumb frigging luck, I noticed that the road ahead suddenly got lighter in color, and that there was no center-line anymore. I assumed the worst and braked hard, rolling onto gravel at about 40mph just as I let off the front brake. To add insult to injury, the crew had placed a &quot;Pavement Ends&quot; sign several hundred feet past the start of the gravel. Thanks, guys.

All three bikes stayed up, but we were not happy campers at all, given absolutely no warning before we potentially lost our shit. This construction zone stretched for 10 or 15 miles, and it took us forever to get to Browning (and cell reception) to call Matt again. We were still 100 miles shy of Kalispell and the sun was going down, so I called Matt and took him up on his offer for crash space after all.

We did our best to follow the roads that AAA called &quot;scenic&quot; on their maps (the ones with the little green dots along the road), and avoid the ones that weren't deemed scenic. So far it had worked out fairly well, but Hwy 2 back to Kalispell was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; marked as scenic and turned out to be fantastic. Riding carefully and watching for all the animals that tend to come out at dusk, we cruised back into Kalispell and eventually found Matt's house.

It was pushing 9pm and hot as hell, so we ordered a couple of pizzas and started to decimate the case of cold &lt;a href=&quot;http://kokaneebeer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kokanee&lt;/a&gt; in Matt's fridge. It became quickly apparent that 12 bottles wasn't going to do the job, and that we were drinking him out of house and home. Matt and I made a quick trip to the local Hot Pocket Store(tm) for a couple more cases, and the rest of the evening was spent eating, drinking, and conversating over a thousand beers. Excellent times, and just what we needed.

            <column name="post_content">Wednesday the 30th brought us our second nugget of excitement, after the high-speed gravel run the night before.

For the first time on the trip, we actually got up at a decent hour and were ready to hit the road &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; before 10am. Thanks to Matt, his shower and his washing machine, we now had clean clothes to put on clean riders, and we were ready to put some serious miles on to make up for the day lost to Glacier.

As Scott and I rounded up the last of our crap in the house, Dylan stepped out to check our tire pressures. Everything seemed normal until he got to my rear tire, which was running 20psi instead of the roughly 42psi it should have had. Sure enough, rolling my bike forward revealed some sort of twisted pair of nails or industrial staple that had punctured my tire in TWO places, barely 1/4&quot; apart from one another.

As I pulled out the offending sharp objects and began to wig out over the destruction of my brand new rear tire, Dylan pulled out the plug kit and went to work. We didn't think it would be possible to put two 3/8&quot; wide mushroom plugs into holes that were 1/4&quot; apart, but I'll be damned if that thing didn't hold air. For the record, when I checked the pressure for the final time 2000 miles later (on the following Saturday morning), it was still holding 41.5psi. Not too shabby, I'd say.

Crisis averted, we loaded up the bikes and rolled down Hwy 35 around Flathead Lake. We ran into our first patch of rain as we approached the lake, a torrential downpour on the horizon that got uglier and uglier as we approached. We were hit with a few heavy drops as we skirted the storm, but we didn't bother to put on rain gear and turned south around the lake (and away from the rain) just as it started to become a concern.

We met two guys from Froggy Canadia touring on sportbikes at a Safeway gas station in Polson. One of them was an idiot (like Scott) touring on an R1 because he evidently had some sort of anger issues with his legs, wrists and lower back and didn't want them to ever be usable again. He even had a jury-rigged Givi case on the back of his R1, just like Scott.

Eventually we made our way south to Lolo, MT for lunch and got onto the much anticipated Hwy 12 over Lolo Pass in Idaho. The road was amazing and scenic, with very little traffic. It twisted along the banks of the Lochsa River, in which we stopped to stare at the overwhelming natural beauty and let Scott dip his obscenely white feet in the water.

Burning daylight again and still far behind from our Glacier delay, we made another command decision and cut out Mt. Rainier and Mt. Saint Helens from this trip, so that we could still spend an evening relaxing in Portland and meeting up with some old friends and still make it home to the bay before November 2012.

Once again we rode until dusk and ended up in Lewiston, ID right across the Snake River from Clarkson, Washington. Cute, huh?

We ended up at the very well maintained (hot running water and showers FTW) &lt;em&gt;Hells Gate State Park&lt;/em&gt; a few feet from the river. We paid and got our assigned campsites from the jailbait working behind the counter at the &lt;em&gt;Lewis &amp;amp; Clark Discovery Center&lt;/em&gt; only to find sprinklers running in the space they assigned us.

After a quick campsite swap, we set up our tents and headed into town for dinner. We grabbed food at a Mexican joint in Lewiston, then some firewood, snacks and alcohol at Albertsons, and headed back to the campground to drink and pass out.

            <column name="post_content">Wednesday the 30th brought us our second nugget of excitement, after the high-speed gravel run the night before.

For the first time on the trip, we actually got up at a decent hour and were ready to hit the road well before 10am. Thanks to Matt, his shower and his washing machine, we now had clean clothes to put on clean riders, and we were ready to put some serious miles on to make up for the day lost to Glacier.

As Scott and I rounded up the last of our crap in the house, Dylan stepped out to check our tire pressures. Everything seemed normal until he got to my rear tire, which was running 20psi instead of the roughly 42psi it should have had. Sure enough, rolling my bike forward revealed some sort of twisted pair of nails or industrial staple that had punctured my tire in TWO places, barely 1/4&quot; apart from one another.

As I pulled out the offending sharp objects and began to wig out over the destruction of my brand new rear tire, Dylan pulled out the plug kit and went to work. We didn't think it would be possible to put two 3/8&quot; wide mushroom plugs into holes that were 1/4&quot; apart, but I'll be damned if that thing didn't hold air. For the record, when I checked the pressure for the final time 2000 miles later (on the following Saturday morning), it was still holding 41.5psi. Not too shabby, I'd say.

Crisis averted, we loaded up the bikes and rolled down Hwy 35 around Flathead Lake, we met two guys from Froggy Canadia touring on sportbikes at a Safeway gas station in Polson. One of them was an idiot (like Scott) touring on an R1 becuase he evidently had some sort of anger issues with his legs, wrists and lower back and didn't want them to ever be usable again.

Eventually we made our way south to Lolo, MT for lunch and got onto the much anticipated Hwy 12 over Lolo Pass in Idaho.

Eventually we made our way south to Lolo, MT for lunch and got onto the much anticipated Hwy 12 over Lolo Pass in Idaho. The road was amazing and scenic, with very little traffic. It twisted along the banks of the Lochsa River, in which we stopped to stare at the overwhelming natural beauty and let Scott dip his bright white feet in the water.

Burning daylight again and still far behind from our Glacier delay, we made another command decision and cut out Mt. Rainier and Mt. Saint Helens from this trip, so that we could still spend an evening relaxing in Portland and meeting up with some old friends.

Once again we rode until dusk and ended up in Lewiston, ID right across the Snake River from Clarkson, Washington. Cute, huh?

We ended up at the very well maintained (hot running water and showers FTW) &lt;em&gt;Hells Gate State Park&lt;/em&gt; a few feet from the river. We paid and got our assigned campsites from the jailbait working behind the counter at the &lt;em&gt;Lewis &amp;amp; Clark Discovery Center&lt;/em&gt; only to find sprinklers running in the space they assigned us.

After a quick campsite swap, we set up our tents and headed into town for dinner. We grabbed food at a Mexican joint in Lewiston, then some firewood, snacks and alcohol at Albertsons, and headed back to the campground to drink and pass out.

            <column name="post_content">Wednesday the 30th brought us our second nugget of excitement, after the high-speed gravel run the night before.

For the first time on the trip, we actually got up at a decent hour and were ready to hit the road &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; before 10am. Thanks to Matt, his shower and his washing machine, we now had clean clothes to put on clean riders, and we were ready to put some serious miles on to make up for the day lost to Glacier.

As Scott and I rounded up the last of our crap in the house, Dylan stepped out to check our tire pressures. Everything seemed normal until he got to my rear tire, which was running 20psi instead of the roughly 42psi it should have had. Sure enough, rolling my bike forward revealed some sort of twisted pair of nails or industrial staple that had punctured my tire in TWO places, barely 1/4&quot; apart from one another.

As I pulled out the offending sharp objects and began to wig out over the destruction of my brand new rear tire, Dylan pulled out the plug kit and went to work. We didn't think it would be possible to put two 3/8&quot; wide mushroom plugs into holes that were 1/4&quot; apart, but I'll be damned if that thing didn't hold air. For the record, when I checked the pressure for the final time 2000 miles later (on the following Saturday morning), it was still holding 41.5psi. Not too shabby, I'd say.

Crisis averted, we loaded up the bikes and rolled down Hwy 35 around Flathead Lake. We ran into our first patch of rain as we approached the lake, a torrential downpour on the horizon that got uglier and uglier as we approached. We got hit with a some heavy drops as we skirted the storm, but we didn't bother to put on rain gear and turned south around the lake (and away from the rain) just as it started to become a concern.

We met two guys from Froggy Canadia touring on sportbikes at a Safeway gas station in Polson. One of them was an idiot (like Scott) touring on an R1 becuase he evidently had some sort of anger issues with his legs, wrists and lower back and didn't want them to ever be usable again.

Eventually we made our way south to Lolo, MT for lunch and got onto the much anticipated Hwy 12 over Lolo Pass in Idaho. The road was amazing and scenic, with very little traffic. It twisted along the banks of the Lochsa River, in which we stopped to stare at the overwhelming natural beauty and let Scott dip his bright white feet in the water.

Burning daylight again and still far behind from our Glacier delay, we made another command decision and cut out Mt. Rainier and Mt. Saint Helens from this trip, so that we could still spend an evening relaxing in Portland and meeting up with some old friends.

Once again we rode until dusk and ended up in Lewiston, ID right across the Snake River from Clarkson, Washington. Cute, huh?

We ended up at the very well maintained (hot running water and showers FTW) &lt;em&gt;Hells Gate State Park&lt;/em&gt; a few feet from the river. We paid and got our assigned campsites from the jailbait working behind the counter at the &lt;em&gt;Lewis &amp;amp; Clark Discovery Center&lt;/em&gt; only to find sprinklers running in the space they assigned us.

After a quick campsite swap, we set up our tents and headed into town for dinner. We grabbed food at a Mexican joint in Lewiston, then some firewood, snacks and alcohol at Albertsons, and headed back to the campground to drink and pass out.

            <column name="post_content">In the morning, we rolled out of our Grinding Rock campsite and up Hwy 88 over Carson Pass, stopping for lunch in Kirkwood along the way. After lunch we rolled over the pass and down into Nevada, stopping for gas and refreshments outside Carson City, and taking a picture of the enormous moth that would be an omen for the insect storm to come.

We didnâ€™t want to take 80 via Reno because 395 between Carson City and Reno are nothing but extreme heat, stop-and-go traffic and exhaust fumes. Instead, my route had us taking Hwy 50 from Carson City all the way out to Fallon, but on the fly I decided to cut up to 80 at Fernley, which turned out to be a good idea.

Once we hit the 75mph speed limit on 80, we made very good time to Winnemucca. The ride was straight, flat, and hot as blazes as expected, but at least we were burning miles quickly. Still, we were burning daylight quickly and, as we took 95 up into eastern Oregon, we watched the sun setting to our left.

At our next gas stop we had to make a command decision. We had some Hot Springs deeper in Oregon recommended by one friend, and a campground on the border recommended by another, but it was apparent that we weren't going to come close to making either by nightfall, so we opted to ride into the night and just get a motel room outside Boise to make up the time and mileage we lost on Friday night.

            <column name="post_content">Thursday's ride was fairly uneventful. Cutting out the two mountains in Washington, we rode down into Oregon via Hwy 12 and Walla Walla.

Somewhere in Oregon we were stopped at a yet another road construction zone, but this time the cute blonde flagperson waved us up to the front of the pack and let us know that we had 10-15 minutes to take off our helmets, rest and chat with her before traffic would be let through.

Eventually we met up with the Columbia River and stopped in Boardman, OR for some agonizingly slow Bozo Burgers (a.k.a. bacon cheeseburgers anywhere else in the universe). Scott got stuck behind a family of 2500 while trying to order his food, including one old man who wrote a personal check for $8.50 to cover his meal, and another old man who inquired if their chili was homemade before taking 10 minutes to haggle and waffle over sundae toppings.

The ride along the Columbia River Gorge was beautiful, but probably would have been a lot more awe-inspiring had we not just come from some of the most beautiful stretches of road in the world.

We eventually hit Portland and got stuck in a hefty traffic jam, which turned out to be the aftermath of a motorcycle accident. An older, small sportbike that was rattle-canned black was being loaded off the road. I thought it was an EX500, but Scott said it looks like a Hurricane.

After some time gritting our teeth while not being able to lanesplit, we made it downtown and pulled off at a parking lot next to the convention center to call our respective friends. We were looking for a place to get a cheap motel room and be able to walk to food and booze. Scott's friend Josh suggested one quarter of town, my friend Jan suggested a different part of town, and Dylan's friend (with whom he was staying) lived in a completely different part of town.

I ended up calling Thatch to break the tie, and Scott and I got a room at 10th and Burnside right across the street from Union Jack's (strip club), the Doug Fir (hipster bar), and next door to the Galaxy Restaurant &amp;amp; Lounge, complete with cheap drinks, decent Chinese food, and horrible karaoke.

After a few beers at the Doug Fir (and breaking a half-full pint glass all over Josh's messenger bag about 8 seconds after meeting him), we moseyed across the street to meet Dylan and his friends Melissa and Erin at the Galaxy. A few more drinks, some pot stickers, and some atrocious singing chased us over to Union Jack's.

Surprisingly, the drinks were bar-priced and not strip-club-priced, as is apparently the norm in Portland. Jan and Erin went their separate ways, and the rest of us spent a couple of hours drinking, talking and occasionally glancing at naked girls. A stripper lit Melissa's cigarette off her nipple (the stripper's, not Melissa's) using a paper match, some saliva and a little yankee ingenuity. Good times.

Eventually Dylan and Melissa took off, then Josh took off, then Scott and I stumbled across the street to our motel room to pass the hell out. We're going to need to get back to Portland again.

            <column name="post_content">Thursday's ride was fairly uneventful. Cutting out the two mountains in Washington, we rode down into Oregon via Hwy 12 and Walla Walla.

Somewhere in Oregon we were stopped at a yet another road construction zone, but this time the cute blonde flagperson waved us up to the front of the pack and let us know that we had 10-15 minutes to take off our helmets, rest and chat with her before traffic would be let through.

Eventually we met up with the Columbia River and stopped in Boardman, OR for some agonizingly slow Bozo Burgers (a.k.a. bacon cheeseburgers anywhere else in the universe). Scott got stuck behind a family of 2500 while trying to order his food, including one old man who wrote a personal check for $8.50 to cover his meal, and another old man who inquired if their chili was homemade before taking 10 minutes to haggle and waffle over sundae toppings.

The ride along the Columbia River Gorge was beautiful, but probably would have been a lot more awe-inspiring had we not just come from some of the most beautiful stretches of road in the world.

We eventually hit Portland and got stuck in a hefty traffic jam, which turned out to be the aftermath of a motorcycle accident. An older, small sportbike that was rattlecanned black was being loaded off the road. I thought it was an EX500, but Scott said it looks like a Hurricane.

After some time gritting our teeth while not being able to lanesplit, we made it downtown and pulled off at a parking lot next to the convention center to call our respective friends. We were looking for a place to get a cheap motel room and be able to walk to food and booze. Scott's friend Josh suggested one quarter of town, my friend Jan suggested a different part of town, and Dylan's friend (with whom he was staying) lived in a completely different part of town.

I ended up calling Thatch to break the tie, and we got a hotel room on SE 10th and E Burnside right across the street from Union Jack's (strip club), the Doug Fir (douchey bar), and next door to the Galaxy Restaurant &amp;amp; Lounge, complete with cheap drinks, decent chinese food, and horrible karaoke.

After a few beers at the Doug Fir (and breaking a half-full pint glass over Josh's messenger bag about 8 seconds after meeting him), we moseyed across the street to meet Dylan and his friends Melissa and Erin at the Galaxy. A few more drinks, some pot stickers, and some atrocious singing chased us over to Union Jack's.

Surprisingly, the drinks were bar-priced and not strip-club-priced, as is apparently the norm in Portland. Jan and Erin took off respectively, and the rest of us spent a couple of hours drinking and talking. A stripper lit Melissa's cigarette off her nipple (the stripper's, not Melissa's) using a paper match, some saliva and a little yankee ingenuity.

Eventually Dylan and Melissa took off, then Josh took off, then Scott and I stumbled across the street to our motel room to pass the hell out. We're going to need to get back to Portland again.</column>

            <column name="post_content">Thursday's ride was fairly uneventful. Cutting out the two mountains in Washington, we rode down into Oregon via Hwy 12 and Walla Walla.

Somewhere in Oregon we were stopped at a yet another road construction zone, but this time the cute blonde flagperson waved us up to the front of the pack and let us know that we had 10-15 minutes to take off our helmets, rest and chat with her before traffic would be let through.

Eventually we met up with the Columbia River and stopped in Boardman, OR for some agonizingly slow Bozo Burgers (a.k.a. bacon cheeseburgers anywhere else in the universe). Scott got stuck behind a family of 2500 while trying to order his food, including one old man who wrote a personal check for $8.50 to cover his meal, and another old man who inquired if their chili was homemade before taking 10 minutes to haggle and waffle over sundae toppings.

The ride along the Columbia River Gorge was beautiful, but probably would have been a lot more awe-inspiring had we not just come from some of the most beautiful stretches of road in the world.

We eventually hit Portland and got stuck in a hefty traffic jam, which turned out to be the aftermath of a motorcycle accident. An older, small sportbike that was rattlecanned black was being loaded off the road. I thought it was an EX500, but Scott said it looks like a Hurricane.

After some time gritting our teeth while not being able to lanesplit, we made it downtown and pulled off at a parking lot next to the convention center to call our respective friends. We were looking for a place to get a cheap motel room and be able to walk to food and booze. Scott's friend Josh suggested one quarter of town, my friend Jan suggested a different part of town, and Dylan's friend (with whom he was staying) lived in a completely different part of town.

I ended up calling Thatch to break the tie, and Scott and I got a room at 10th and Burnside right across the street from Union Jack's (strip club), the Doug Fir (hipster bar), and next door to the Galaxy Restaurant &amp;amp; Lounge, complete with cheap drinks, decent chinese food, and horrible karaoke.

After a few beers at the Doug Fir (and breaking a half-full pint glass all over Josh's messenger bag about 8 seconds after meeting him), we moseyed across the street to meet Dylan and his friends Melissa and Erin at the Galaxy. A few more drinks, some pot stickers, and some atrocious singing chased us over to Union Jack's.

Surprisingly, the drinks were bar-priced and not strip-club-priced, as is apparently the norm in Portland. Jan and Erin went their separate ways, and the rest of us spent a couple of hours drinking and talking. A stripper lit Melissa's cigarette off her nipple (the stripper's, not Melissa's) using a paper match, some saliva and a little yankee ingenuity. Good times.

Eventually Dylan and Melissa took off, then Josh took off, then Scott and I stumbled across the street to our motel room to pass the hell out. We're going to need to get back to Portland again.

            <column name="post_content">Slightly hungover, we woke up to drizzle in Portland. Scott and I cleaned up and walked over to J &amp;amp; M's for breakfast, a place a few blocks away that Josh had recommended. We both had the J &amp;amp; M Plate, which consisted of two fried eggs on toasted english muffins, smothered in a ton of melted fontina cheese and crossed with two thick strips of bacon. Quite tasty and about 750,000 calories I'm sure.

After breakfast and several cups of fine Portland coffee, we walked back to the hotel, packed up the bikes, and rolled over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/backspace-portland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Backspace&lt;/a&gt;, the gamer-centric cafe where Josh works. We got the grand tour, and Josh hooked us up with half a dozen excellent caffeinated beverages that would ensure piss-breaks every 6 miles, and a severe case of the shakes for most of the day.

Dylan rolled up after a bit, and the three of us took off south on I-5 out of Portland. The drizzle had let up and appeared (from my iPhone weather radar thingy) that the rain was isolated, so we didn't bother with rain gear. Somewhere north of Salem, however, it started raining on us again and we pulled off at a gas station south of the city to fuel up and don our rain gear.

Dylan stuck it out in just his leathers while Scott and I got geared up. After some Red Bull and trail mix, we were ready to continue on, but Scott couldn't find his Icon Ti-Max motorcycle gloves. He had evidently placed them on top of the gas pump he was using earlier, and some methed-out dick was kind enough to steal them in the ten minutes that had elapsed since we got gas.

I loaned Scott my summer gloves because it wasn't very cold and I was wearing my gore-tex winter gloves anyway, and we looked up a Cycle Gear store in Eugene, OR before getting back on the freeway. Upon arriving in Eugene, Scott ended up picking up a cheap pair of crap leather gloves just to get him home, and I sat in the parking lot and stared at my motorcycle chain that kept stretching and stretching beyond belief.

The chain wasn't even close to 10k miles old on this RK X-ring 530 chain (normally get an easy 20k+ out of each chain), but but this point the adjuster screws were backed all the way out and the chain was still drooping uncomfortably low. It was making a little noise here an there upon deceleration, but at this point it seemed FAR from unsafe, so I didn't get the slightest inkling to buy a new chain or at least a $4 masterlink to pop a few links out of the existing one to get me home. More on that later.

We merged back onto 5 and cruised south, stopping for gas at a Chevron in Medford, OR. After getting off the freeway, Dylan's FZ6 would not kick into 1st gear, and we thought we might have another small disaster on our hands, but eventually Scott got it into gear and it was fine from then on. Go figure.

We grabbed dinner at the Black Bear Diner in Medford around sunset, before getting back on the freeway. The portions were retarded huge, the staff all seemed a bit slow in the noggin, and three filthy, road-weary bikers were definitely out of place in this family chain restaurant.

After dinner, we continued south and happily crossed into California (to higher speed limits and slightly less rabid highway patrol) in the dark. We made it down to Hwy 96 just north of Yreka and (very) slowly rode the pitch-black twisty road to our destination campground in the Klamath National Forest, all the while watching intently for deer, bears, moose, elk, elephants, rhino or whatever other manner of bloodthirsty beast might jump out in front of us and kill us all in a fiery gasoline-soaked inferno. Somehow, facing all that extreme peril, we made it the 12 miles to the campground safely.

Scott coughed up the $10 for the site into the self-pay envelope, we set up camp quickly in the dark, and hit the sack when the insects started to get the best of us.

Oh, and somewhere between Salem and Eugene my bike turned over 70,000 miles on the odometer. :)

It was making some noise on deceleration, but at this point it seemed FAR from unsafe, so I didn't get the slightest inkling to buy a new chain or a tool to pop a few links out of the existing one to get me home.

We got back on 5 and cruised south, stopping for gas at a Chevron in Medford. After getting off the freeway, Dylan's FZ6 would not kick into 1st gear, and we thought we might have another small disaster on our hands, but eventually Scott got it into gear and it was fine from then on. Go figure.

We grabbed dinner at the Black Bear Diner in Medford around sunset, before getting back on the freeway. The portions were retarded huge, the staff all seemed a bit slow in the noggins, and the three of us were definitely out of place in this rural family restaurant.

After dinner, we continued south and happily crossed into California (to higher speed limits and slightly less rabid highway patrol) in the dark. We made it down to Hwy 96 just north of Yreka and (very) slowly rode the pitch-black twisty road a few miles to our campground in the Klamath National Forest while watching intently for deer, bears, moose, elk, elephants, rhino or whatever other manner of beast might jump out in front of us and kill us all in a fiery gasoline-soaked inferno.

Scott coughed up the $10 for the site into the self-pay envelope, we set up camp quickly in the dark, and hit the sack.

            <column name="post_content">Slightly hungover, we woke up to drizzle in Portland. Scott and I cleaned up and walked over to J &amp;amp; M's for breakfast, a place a few blocks away that Josh had recommended. We both had the J &amp;amp; M Plate, which consisted of two fried eggs on toasted english muffins, covered with a ton of melted fontina cheese and two thick strips of bacon. Quite tasty and about 750,000 calories I'm sure.

After breakfast and several cups of fine Portland coffee, we walked back to the hotel, packed up the bikes, and rolled over to Backspace, the gamer-centric cafe where Josh works. We got the grand tour, and Josh hooked us up with half a dozen excellent caffeinated beverages that would ensure piss-breaks every 6 miles, and a severe case of the shakes for most of the day.

Dylan rolled up after a bit, and the three of us took off south on I-5 out of Portland. The drizzle had let up and appeared (from my iPhone weather radar thingy) that the rain was isolated, so we didn't bother with rain gear. Somewhere north of Salem, however, it started raining on us again and we pulled off at a gas station south of the city to fuel up and don our rain gear.

Dylan stuck it out in just his leathers while Scott and I got geared up. After some Red Bull and trail mix, we were ready to continue on, but Scott couldn't find his Icon Ti-Max motorcycle gloves. He had evidently placed them on top of the gas pump he was using earlier, and some methed-out dick was kind enough to steal them in the ten minutes that had elapsed since we got gas.

I loaned Scott my summer gloves because it wasn't very cold and I was wearing my gore-tex winter gloves anyway, and we looked up a Cycle Gear store in Eugene, OR before getting back on the freeway. Upon arriving in Eugene, Scott ended up picking up a cheap pair of crap leather gloves just to get him home, and I sat in the parking lot and stared at my motorcycle chain that kept stretching and stretching beyond belief.

The chain wasn't even close to 10k miles old (I normally get 20k+ out of each chain), but but this point the adjuster screws were backed all the way out and the chain was still drooping uncomfortably low. It was making some noise on deceleration, but at this point it seemed FAR from unsafe, so I didn't get the slightest inkling to buy a new chain or a tool to pop a few links out of the existing one to get me home. More on this later.

Go figure.

We grabbed dinner at the Black Bear Diner in Medford around sunset, before getting back on the freeway. The portions were retarded huge, the staff all seemed a bit slow in the noggins, and the three of us were definitely out of place in this rural family restaurant.

After dinner, we continued south and happily crossed into California (to higher speed limits and slightly less rabid highway patrol) in the dark. We made it down to Hwy 96 just north of Yreka and (very) slowly rode the pitch-black twisty road a few miles to our campground in the Klamath National Forest while watching intently for deer, bears, moose, elk, elephants, rhino or whatever other manner of beast might jump out in front of us and kill us all in a fiery gasoline-soaked inferno.

Scott coughed up the $10 for the site into the self-pay envelope, we set up camp quickly in the dark, and hit the sack when the insects started to get the be.

            <column name="post_content">Slightly hungover, we woke up to drizzle in Portland. Scott and I cleaned up and walked over to J &amp;amp; M's for breakfast, a place a few blocks away that Josh had recommended. We both had the J &amp;amp; M Plate, which consisted of two fried eggs on toasted english muffins, smothered in a ton of melted fontina cheese and crossed with two thick strips of bacon. Quite tasty and about 750,000 calories I'm sure.

After breakfast and several cups of fine Portland coffee, we walked back to the hotel, packed up the bikes, and rolled over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/backspace-portland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Backspace&lt;/a&gt;, the gamer-centric cafe where Josh works. We got the grand tour, and Josh hooked us up with half a dozen excellent caffeinated beverages that would ensure piss-breaks every 6 miles, and a severe case of the shakes for most of the day.

Dylan rolled up after a bit, and the three of us took off south on I-5 out of Portland. The drizzle had let up and appeared (from my iPhone weather radar thingy) that the rain was isolated, so we didn't bother with rain gear. Somewhere north of Salem, however, it started raining on us again and we pulled off at a gas station south of the city to fuel up and don our rain gear.

Dylan stuck it out in just his leathers while Scott and I got geared up. After some Red Bull and trail mix, we were ready to continue on, but Scott couldn't find his Icon Ti-Max motorcycle gloves. He had evidently placed them on top of the gas pump he was using earlier, and some methed-out dick was kind enough to steal them in the ten minutes that had elapsed since we got gas.

I loaned Scott my summer gloves because it wasn't very cold and I was wearing my gore-tex winter gloves anyway, and we looked up a Cycle Gear store in Eugene, OR before getting back on the freeway. Upon arriving in Eugene, Scott ended up picking up a cheap pair of crap leather gloves just to get him home, and I sat in the parking lot and stared at my motorcycle chain that kept stretching and stretching beyond belief.

The chain wasn't even close to 10k miles old on this RK X-ring 530 chain (normally get an easy 20k+ out of each chain), but but this point the adjuster screws were backed all the way out and the chain was still drooping uncomfortably low. It was making a little noise here an there upon deceleration, but at this point it seemed FAR from unsafe, so I didn't get the slightest inkling to buy a new chain or at least a $4 masterlink to pop a few links out of the existing one to get me home. More on that later.

We merged back onto 5 and cruised south, stopping for gas at a Chevron in Medford, OR. After getting off the freeway, Dylan's FZ6 would not kick into 1st gear, and we thought we might have another small disaster on our hands, but eventually Scott got it into gear and it was fine from then on. Go figure.

We grabbed dinner at the Black Bear Diner in Medford around sunset, before getting back on the freeway. The portions were retarded huge, the staff all seemed a bit slow in the noggin, and three filthy, road-weary bikers were definitely out of place in this family chain restaurant.

After dinner, we continued south and happily crossed into California (to higher speed limits and slightly less rabid highway patrol) in the dark. We made it down to Hwy 96 just north of Yreka and (very) slowly rode the pitch-black twisty road to our destination campground in the Klamath National Forest, all the while watching intently for deer, bears, moose, elk, elephants, rhino or whatever other manner of bloodthirsty beast might jump out in front of us and kill us all in a fiery gasoline-soaked inferno. Somehow, facing all that extreme peril, we made it the 12 miles to the campground safely.

Scott coughed up the $10 for the site into the self-pay envelope, we set up camp quickly in the dark, and hit the sack when the insects started to get the best of us.

Oh, and somewhere between Salem and Eugene my bike turned over 70,000 miles on the odometer. :)

            <column name="post_content">In the morning, we rolled out of our Grinding Rock campsite and up Hwy 88 over Carson Pass, stopping for lunch in Kirkwood along the way. After lunch we rolled over the pass and down into Nevada, stopping for gas and refreshments outside Carson City, and taking a picture of the enormous moth that would be an omen for the insect storm to come.

We didnâ€™t want to take 80 via Reno because 395 between Carson City and Reno are nothing but extreme heat, stop-and-go traffic and exhaust fumes. Instead, my route had us taking Hwy 50 from Carson City all the way out to Fallon, but on the fly I decided to cut up to 80 at Fernley, which turned out to be a good idea.

Once we hit the 75mph speed limit on 80, we made very good time to Winnemucca. The ride was straight, flat, and hot as blazes as expected, but at least we were burning miles quickly. Still, we were burning daylight quickly and, as we took 95 up into eastern Oregon, we watched the sun setting to our left.

At our next gas stop we had to make a command decision. We had some Hot Springs deeper in Oregon recommended by one friend, and a campground on the border recommended by another, but it was apparent that we weren't going to come close to making either by nightfall, so we opted to ride into the night and just get a motel room outside Boise to make up the time and mileage we lost on Friday night.

We rode well into the night, being as paranoid as possible about animals on the road, and sailing through an absolutely insane monsoon of insects along the Oregon/Idaho border. We stopped for dinner at a Shari's (the only thing that was open) on the outskirts of Boise and I went ahead and made the first potato joke of the week, commenting on how incredibly fresh Shari's waffle-cut fries were.

We ended up settling in at a Motel 6 on the other end of Boise (by the airport) and sleeping like logs.

            <column name="post_content">We woke up and packed up camp under the already-sweltering sun.

Before hitting the road, we decided to take some time riding around the park and exploring a few of the cool volcanic formations. We spent a while looking through some of the lava cones, and Scott and Dylan hiked to the top of one of the huge hills of black rock.

On the way out, we asked the ranger at the gate about taking Hwy 93 up through eastern Idaho instead of taking I-15 up into Montana. He confirmed that 93 was more scenic, and told us it followed the Salmon River. From past experience, the three of us knew that any road that follows a river or creek is generally good, so we went with the new route.

The first leg of 93 was flat and boring as expected--we were still in the agricultural (relative) lowlands of southern Idaho, but we had mountains in front of us and were looking forward to riding in them. We stopped for a ridiculously large lunch in Challis, ID where our AAA map said the scenic part of the road started. As promised, 93 from then on was beautiful. The roads were in excellent shape, and there was almost no one on the road. We hauled some fairly respectable ass.

Once we crossed the border the speed limits went up significantly and so did our pace. With the glorious Montana speed limits, we were also met with a veritable ton of road construction, including quite a few stretches of nasty oiled gravel. We made good time between constructions zones, but were often held up for 10-15 minutes a pop when we hit another work site, and then a lot more time cruising over the gravel at 5mph.

We cruised into Missoula, MT at dusk and stopped at the Walmart for some supplies, then decided to cut out to 93 via Hwy 200 and look for camping at Salmon Lake or Placid Lake. We ended up settling in at Salmon Lake, which had running water, hot showers and a firewood dispenser that resembled a gigantic, wooden coke machine. We put in 16 quarters and got a dry bundle of tiny logs that weighed about 3 ounces. Unfortunately, it took us four $4 bundles of balsa to realize that a neighboring (empty) campsite had a pile of huge, heavy logs that would probably burn all night, but we pilfered a few of them anyway to keep the fire going.

Most campsites have an entry fee that covers 1 vehicle, and an additional vehicle fee for extra cars. Salmon Lake was $15 for the site, and appeared to be an additional $5 for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; vehicle. Like we did at the campsite in Pine Grove, CA, we put cash for the site and 1.5 cars (6 wheels/3 bikes) in the self-pay envelope and waited to see if a ranger would hassle us in the morning. I was the first one up the next morning and, sure enough, a ranger rolled up like clockwork to (presumably) give us grief for not paying for 3 full vehicles. Instead, the ranger walked right up to me, handed me $8 back, and told me that the camp fee included all our vehicles. Gotta love Montana.

            <column name="post_content">We packed up our bikes in the Motel 6 parking lot and hit the road toward the Sawtooth Mountains. The ride up was beautiful and twisty, and the roads were fairly smooth and well maintained. There were plenty of cars and bikes on the road, but we weren't really held back and had plenty of opportunities to pass for the most part.

We stopped for lunch in Stanley, Idaho and got horrible service from a very personable waiter. Dylan and I got our food finally, but Scott's club sandwich sat on the counter for a good ten minutes while he watched us eat. Eventually, I got up and told another waitress I was going to take the food so we could eat and get out of dodge.

Getting geared up to leave, we spoke to a husband and wife touring on an FZ1 and SV650 respectively, as well as our first of many groups of helmetless riders on their way to Sturgis. Everyone was extremely friendly no matter what type of ride they were on.

The cruise south from Stanley was mostly flat farmland, and not nearly as interesting as I expected. We stopped in Sun Valley for gas and a rest, and eventually ended up at Craters on the Moon National Park before sunset. We acquired our campsite and set up our tents, then Scott and I flew into the nearest town (Arco, ID) for beer and snacks while Dylan finished setting up camp and explored a couple of the volcanic caves in the park.

Night fell, but the moon didn't come up until well into the wee hours of the morning. We passed a few hours drinking and playing dominoes while listning to Patton Oswalt and David Cross albums on my iPod. I won with 300 points, Dylan had 205 and Scott took (it) up the rear with 190.

            <column name="post_content">We woke up fairly early on Saturday morning. We were having a great time on this trip, but 8 1/2 days of solid riding and sleeping on the ground is quite a bit--we were exhausted and ready to be home.

I'd been waiting quite a while for the opportunity to ride Hwy 96 along the Klamath River. The north end starts just south of the Oregon border, so it's not an easy road to ride in just a weekend. The road that it meets on its southern end in Willow Creek (Hwy 299) follows the Trinity River and is one of my all-time favorite roads--I try to ride it at least two or three times a year.

We left the campground around 9:15, and my chain was drooping lower than ever. Given that my adjuster screws had hit their limit a day or two prior, I didn't have much choice but to grin and bear it. The previous day's ride was almost entirely freeway riding down I-5 and it hadn't given me too much grief, probably due to the (relatively) constant speed and throttle of freeway riding compared to being on back roads.

As we rolled out of the campground, the chain it was still making quite a clatter upon deceleration (when the slack bunches up it was slapping against the swingarm), so I asked Dylan to lead and I rode third behind Scott. With iffy acceleration and no engine breaking at my disposal, I really didn't want to rail through the hills.

From our Saturday starting point just outside Yreka, was 152 miles to Willow Creek, an additional 47 or so to Eureka, followed by 270 back to San Francisco--at almost 500 miles, it was going to be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; day.

Barely twenty or thirty miles into Hwy 96, we hit smoke. It was heavy smoke, and getting heavier by the mile. I didn't remember hearing about any major fires on this side of I-5 (most were in the Sierra foothills), but this was evidently a doozy. We rode through some manner of smoke for at least forty or fifty miles, and at its thickest I could barely see the river a few hundred feet below the road. My eyes were burning, my nose was burning, and my chain was not cooperating.

Once the smoke started to clear a bit (about half way to Willow Creek), we stopped for a break at a gravel clearing along the river. We hydrated and micturated as needed, and I picked and inhaled a big handful of blackberries from the acres of bushes nearby...not necessarily in that order. At this point, my chain was misbehaving on deceleration &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; acceleration, and I was having a hell of a time feathering the clutch just to get over the smallest of hills. I still thought that, once we got to 101, I could limp her home and deal with the chain in the comfort of my own garage, with myriad tools and motorcycle shop parts counters at my disposal.

We saddled back up and plodded on, but another 20 or 30 miles passed and my chain was getting exponentially worse with every passing mile. By now it was clattering constantly, at every speed and throttle position, and my concern level went from from &quot;this seriously sucks&quot; to &quot;this is seriously dangerous&quot; like a light switch.

Dylan and Deeter were far ahead of me (as I was plodding along and feathering the clutch constantly at 30mph in a 55 zone that could be taken safely at 75). After I comitted the ultimate ego-suicide and waved a big, slow Harley past me, I think that Scott got an inkling that something was wrong and slowed down until he was right in front of me. I waved at him to pull over, parked the bike and got off.

I put on one of the nitrex gloves I'd brought and tugged at the chain--sure enough, it was loose enough that it could have &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; jumped the sprocket and destroyed my bike and/or me in the process. I decided that I'd be lucky to make it the last 30 or 40 miles to Willow Creek, let alone another 47 to Eureka, and that there was no way I'd make it back to San Francisco on this chain.

Scott and I decided that he should run ahead and catch Dylan and send him back to escort me as far as I could go. Since Scott had a Blackberry (the internet phone, not the type I'd been picking earlier), he was going to race ahead to Eureka and start making phone calls to motorcycle shops he could find. I was looking for (in this order): [1] A shop with a service department that could swap my chain for me, [2] A gear/parts shop that could sell me a new chain with a clip-style master link I could mount myself in a parking lot, or [3] a clip-style master link, a hacksaw and a nail, so I could knock out a few links with Deeter's rubber tent-stake mallet and clip the shitty chain back together just to get home.

At that point, I'd have been happy with some bailing wire or a handful of paperclips that I could string together and wrap around my sprockets. A few phone calls found a Honda dealership just south of us in Eureka that had a Western Powersports (a.k.a. generic crap) 530 chain in 120 links for $98. I didn't know what kind of master link it had, and I would have to find a way to kick out the 8 extra links, but I figured I'd deal with that at the shop.

I left Deeter and Dylan to have lunch at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostcoast.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lost Coast Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that I could get a new chain while they were eating and not cause much more of a delay than I already had. As I putted down 101 through downtown Eureka, feathering/burning out the clutch like I'd been doing for the past 200 miles, I passed a Kawasaki/KTM dealership on the left that I didn't find via Google earlier.

I decided to stop and see what they had, just for good measure. I walked up to the parts counter and asked if they had any 530 O or X-ring chains on the shelf. The parts guy walked into the back room and came out with a DID O-Ring chain.

&quot;We have this one, how many links do you need?&quot;

&quot;112&quot;

&quot;This one's a 112.&quot;

&quot;Awesome. What kind of master link, clip or rivet?&quot;

He opened up the box and it was a rivet-style master link. I asked if they had a rivet press tool I could borrow to put it on my bike, and explained that I was 300 miles from home on the tail end of a 3,000 mile ride. He asked if I wanted to buy one but I already own one, so so he asked his service guy if he could put the chain on for me, which he promptly did in about 20 minutes. $169 out-the-door for parts and service, barely $20 more than I would have paid at home to put the chain on myself. I called Scott and made it back to Lost Coast while they were still waiting for the check. Perfect. Kick-ass. High-5.

The three of us took off again down 101 and cruised about 50 miles to Miranda, CA to get gas. I sucked down a Red Bull and some of Dylan's copious trail mix, since I'd skipped lunch to get the new chain. Meanwhile, as we were parked up against the air/water station, Dylan said his bike was feeling a bit wonky and decided to check his tire pressure. Sure enough, he had a small puncture slowly leaking air out of his rear tire and his pressure was &amp;lt;20psi.

I'll be damned if that bastard had the repair kit out, and the tire plugged and refilled in about three minutes--before Scott and I had even finished our beverages. I wish we had more of a story for that incident, but the tire went from flat to fixed and full in minutes, and we were back on the road again. Kind of anti-climactic, if you ask me.

The rest of the ride home was uneventful and stress-free, thankfully. I'd forgotten how beautiful Hwy 101 was up through Humboldt and Mendocino counties. Nothing broke, and nothing was lost or stolen along the way. We stopped in Ukiah for gas and rest before our last 100 mile stretch home, and ended up chatting with a CHP officer about riding for a while. We complained about not being able to legally lanesplit past the traffic jam in Portland, and the officer said &quot;you should have just done it, how would they even catch you?&quot; Lulz. They caught my friend Jess just a couple weeks prior doing exactly that through Oregon, so evidently they have some practice at it.

Scott broke off on the bridge for home in Daly City, and Dylan and I cruised to my apartment. Julius was fairly indifferent at my arrival, but Addie was absolutely insane. He meowed endlessly and followed me around the house, and stood outside the bathroom door and cried for 20 minutes while I showered and shaved. Adorable.

Dylan and I got freshened up and walked down to DNA around 11pm to see friends, unwind and get mad crunk, yo. A couple of Chupa drinks later and we stumbled home and passed out.

And the rest is history.

Fin.

            <column name="post_content">We woke up fairly early on Saturday morning. We were having a great time on this trip, but 8 1/2 days of solid riding and sleeping on the ground is quite a bit--we were exhausted and ready to be home.

I'd been waiting quite a while for the opportunity to ride Hwy 96 along the Klamath River. The north end starts just south of the Oregon border, so it's not an easy road to ride in just a weekend. The road that it meets on its southern end in Willow Creek (Hwy 299) follows the Trinity River and is one of my all-time favorite roads--I try to ride it at least two or three times a year.

We left the campground around 9:15, and my chain was drooping lower than ever. Given that my adjuster screws had hit their limit a day or two prior, I didn't have much choice but to grin and bear it. The previous day's ride was almost entirely freeway riding down I-5 and it hadn't given me too much grief, probably due to the (relatively) constant speed and throttle of freeway riding compared to being on back roads.

As we rolled out of the campground, the chain it was still making quite a clatter upon deceleration (when the slack bunches up it was slapping the swingarm), so I asked Dylan to lead and I rode third behind Scott. With iffy acceleration and no engine breaking at my disposal, I really didn't want to rail through the hills.

From our Saturday starting point just outside Yreka, was 152 miles to Willow Creek, an additional 47 or so to Eureka, followed by 270 back to San Francisco--at almost 500 miles it was going to be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; day.

Barely twenty or thirty miles into Hwy 96, we hit smoke. It was heavy smoke, and getting heavier by the mile. I didn't remember hearing about any major fires on this side of I-5 (most were in the Sierras), but this was evidently a doozy. We rode through some manner of smoke for at least forty or fifty miles, and at its thickest I could barely see the river a few hundred feet below the road. My eyes were burning, my nose was burning, and my chain was not cooperating.

Once the smoke started to clear a bit (about half way to Willow Creek), we stopped for a break at a gravel clearing along the river. We hydrated and micturated as needed, and I picked and inhaled a big handful of blackberries from the acres of bushes nearby...not necessarily in that order. At this point, my chain was misbehaving on deceleration &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; acceleration, and I was having a hell of a time feathering the clutch just to get over the smallest of hills. Still, I thought that once we got to 101 I could limp her home and deal with the chain in the comfort of my own garage, with myriad tools and motorcycle shop parts counters at my disposal.

By now it was clattering constantly, at every speed and throttle position, and my concern level went from from &quot;this seriously sucks&quot; to &quot;this is seriously dangerous&quot; like a light switch.

Dylan and Deeter were far ahead of me (as I was plodding along and feathering the clutch constantly at 30mph in a 55 zone that could be taken safely at 75). After I comitted the ultimate ego-suicide and waved a big, slow Harley past me, I think that Scott got an inkling that something was wrong and slowed down until he was right in front of me. I waved at him to pull over, parked the bike and got off.

I put on one of the nitrex gloves I'd brought and tugged at the chain--sure enough, it was loose enough that it could have &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; jumped the sprocket and destroyed my bike and/or me in the process. I decided that I'd be lucky to make it the last 30 or 40 miles to Willow Creek, let alone another 47 to Eureka, and that there was no way I'd make it back to San Francisco on this chain.

            <column name="post_content">We woke up fairly early on Saturday morning. We were having a great time on this trip, but 8 1/2 days of solid riding and sleeping on the ground is quite a bit--we were exhausted and ready to be home.

I'd been waiting quite a while for the opportunity to ride Hwy 96 along the Klamath River. The north end starts just south of the Oregon border, so it's not an easy road to ride in just a weekend. The road that it meets on its southern end in Willow Creek (Hwy 299) follows the Trinity River and is one of my all-time favorite roads--I try to ride it at least two or three times a year.

We left the campground around 9:15, and my chain was drooping lower than ever. Given that my adjuster screws had hit their limit a day or two prior, I didn't have much choice but to grin and bear it. The previous day's ride was almost entirely freeway riding down I-5 and it hadn't given me too much grief, probably due to the (relatively) constant speed and throttle of freeway riding compared to being on back roads.

As we rolled out of the campground, the chain it was still making quite a clatter upon deceleration (when the slack bunches up it was slapping the swingarm), so I asked Dylan to lead and I rode third behind Scott. With iffy acceleration and no engine breaking at my disposal, I really didn't want to rail through the hills.

From our Saturday starting point just outside Yreka, was 152 miles to Willow Creek, an additional 47 or so to Eureka, followed by 270 back to San Francisco--at almost 500 miles it was going to be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; day.

Barely twenty or thirty miles into Hwy 96, we hit smoke. It was heavy smoke, and getting heavier by the mile. I didn't remember hearing about any major fires on this side of I-5 (most were in the Sierras), but this was evidently a doozy. We rode through some manner of smoke for at least forty or fifty miles, and at its thickest I could barely see the river a few hundred feet below the road. My eyes were burning, my nose was burning, and my chain was not cooperating.

Once the smoke started to clear a bit (about half way to Willow Creek), we stopped for a break at a gravel clearing along the river. We hydrated and micturated as needed, and I picked and inhaled a big handful of blackberries from the acres of bushes nearby...not necessarily in that order. At this point, my chain was misbehaving on deceleration &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; acceleration, and I was having a hell of a time feathering the clutch just to get over the smallest of hills. Still, I thought that once we got to 101 I could limp her home and deal with the chain in the comfort of my own garage, with myriad tools and motorcycle shop parts counters at my disposal.

We saddled back up and plodded on, but another 20 or 30 miles passed and my chain was getting exponentially worse with every passing mile. By now it was clattering constantly, at every speed and throttle position, and my concern level went from from &quot;this seriously sucks&quot; to &quot;this is seriously dangerous&quot; like a light switch.

Dylan and Deeter were far ahead of me (as I was plodding along and feathering the clutch constantly at 30mph in a 55 zone that could be taken safely at 75). After I comitted the ultimate ego-suicide and waved a big, slow Harley past me, I think that Scott got an inkling that something was wrong and slowed down until he was right in front of me. I waved at him to pull over, parked the bike and got off.

I put on one of the nitrex gloves I'd brought and tugged at the chain--sure enough, it was loose enough that it could have &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; jumped the sprocket and destroyed my bike and/or me in the process. I decided that I'd be lucky to make it the last 30 or 40 miles to Willow Creek, let alone another 47 to Eureka, and that there was no way I'd make it back to San Francisco on this chain.

Scott and I decided that he should run ahead and catch Dylan and send him back to escort me as far as I could go. Since Scott had a Blackberry (the internet phone, not the type I'd been picking earlier), he was going to race ahead to Eureka and start making phone calls to motorcycle shops he could find. I was looking for (in this order): [1] A shop with a service department that could swap my chain for me, [2] A gear/parts shop that could sell me a new chain with a clip-style master link I could mount myself in a parking lot, or [3] a clip-style master link, a hacksaw and a nail, so I could knock out a few links with Deeter's rubber tent-stake mallet and clip the shitty chain back together just to get home.

At that point, I'd have been happy with some bailing wire or a handful of paperclips that I could string together and wrap around my sprockets. A few phone calls found a Honda dealership just south of us in Eureka that had a Western Powersports (a.k.a. generic crap) 530 chain in 120 links for $98. I didn't know what kind of master link it had, and I would have to find a way to kick out the 8 extra links, but I figured I'd deal with that at the shop.

I left Deeter and Dylan to have lunch at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostcoast.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lost Coast Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that I could get a new chain while they were eating and not cause much more of a delay than I already had. As I putted down 101 through downtown Eureka, feathering/burning out the clutch like I'd been doing for the past 200 miles, I passed a Kawasaki/KTM dealership on the left that I didn't find via Google earlier.

I decided to stop and see what they had, just for good measure. I walked up to the parts counter and asked if they had any 530 O or X-ring chains on the shelf. The parts guy walked into the back room and came out with a DID O-Ring chain.

&quot;We have this one, how many links do you need?&quot;

&quot;112&quot;

&quot;This one's a 112.&quot;

&quot;Awesome. What kind of master link, clip or rivet?&quot;

He opened up the box and it was a rivet-style master link. I asked if they had a rivet press tool I could borrow to put it on my bike, and explained that I was 300 miles from home on the tail end of a 3,000 ride. He asked if I wanted to buy one but I already own one, so so he asked his service guy if he could put the chain on for me, which he promptly did in about 20 minutes. $169 out-the-door for parts and service, barely $20 more than I would have paid at home to put the chain on myself. I called Scott and made it back to Lost Coast while they were still waiting for the check. Perfect. Kick-ass. High-5.

The three of us took off again down 101 and cruised about 50 miles to Miranda, CA to get gas. I sucked down a Red Bull and some of Dylan's copious trail mix, since I'd skipped lunch to get a new chain. Meanwhile, as we were parked up against the air/water station, Dylan said his bike was feeling a bit wonky and decided to check his tire pressure. Sure enough, he had a small puncture slowly leaking air out of his rear tire and his pressure was &amp;lt;20psi.

I'll be damned if that bastard had the repair kit out, and the tire plugged and refilled in about three minutes--before Scott and I had even finished our beverages. I wish we had more of a story for that incident, but the tire went from flat to fixed and full in minutes, and we were back on the road again. Kind of anti-climactic, if you ask me.

The rest of the ride home was uneventful and stress-free, thankfully. I'd forgotten how beautiful Hwy 101 was up through Humboldt and Mendocino counties. Nothing broke, and nothing was lost or stolen along the way. We stopped in Ukiah for gas and rest before our last 100 mile stretch home, and ended up chatting with a CHP officer for a while about riding for a while. We complained about not being able to legally lanesplit past the traffic jam in Portland, and the officer said &quot;you should have just done it, how would they even catch you?&quot; Lulz. They caugt my friend Jess just a couple weeks prior doing exactly that through Oregon, so evidently they have some practice at it.

Scott broke off on the bridge for home in Daly City, and Dylan and I cruised to my apartment. Julius was fairly indifferent at my arrival, but Addie was absolutely insane. He meowed endlessly and followed me around the house, and stood outside the bathroom door and cried for 20 minutes while I showered and shaved. Adorable.

Dylan and I got freshened up and walked down to DNA around 11pm to see friends, unwind and get mad crunk. A couple of Chupa drinks later and we stumbled home and passed out.

And the rest is history.

Fin.

Since Scott had a Blackberry (the internet phone, not the type I'd been picking earlier), he was going to race ahead to Eureka and start making phone calls to motorcycle shops he could find. I was looking for (in this order): [1] A shop with a service department that could swap my chain for me, [2] A gear/parts shop that could sell me a new chain with a clip-style master link I could mount myself in a parking lot, or [3] a clip-style master link, a hacksaw and a nail, so I could knock out a few links with Deeter's rubber tent-stake mallet and clip the shitty chain back together just to get home.

At that point, I'd have been happy with some bailing wire or a handful of paperclips that I could string together and wrap around my sprockets. A few phone calls found a Honda dealership just south of us in Eureka that had a Western Powersports (a.k.a. generic crap) 530 chain in 120 links for $98. I didn't know what kind of master link it had, and I would have to find a way to kick out the 8 extra links, but I figured I'd deal with that at the shop.

I left Deeter and Dylan to have lunch at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostcoast.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lost Coast Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that I could get a new chain while they were eating and not cause much more of a delay than I already had. As I putted down 101 through downtown Eureka, feathering/burning out the clutch like I'd been doing for the past 200 miles, I passed a Kawasaki/KTM dealership on the left that I didn't find via Google earlier.

I decided to stop and see what they had, just for good measure. I walked up to the parts counter and asked if they had any 530 O or X-ring chains on the shelf. The parts guy walked into the back room and came out with a DID O-Ring chain.

&quot;We have this one, how many links do you need?&quot;

&quot;112&quot;

&quot;This one's a 112.&quot;

&quot;Awesome. What kind of master link, clip or rivet?&quot;

He opened up the box and it was a rivet-style master link. I asked if they had a rivet press tool I could borrow to put it on my bike, and explained that I was 300 miles from home on the tail end of a 3,000 ride. He asked if I wanted to buy one but I already own one, so so he asked his service guy if he could put the chain on for me, which he promptly did in about 20 minutes. $169 out-the-door for parts and service, barely $20 more than I would have paid at home to put the chain on myself. I called Scott and made it back to Lost Coast while they were still waiting for the check. Perfect. Kick-ass. High-5.

The three of us took off again down 101 and cruised about 50 miles to Miranda, CA to get gas. I sucked down a Red Bull and some of Dylan's copious trail mix, since I'd skipped lunch to get a new chain. Meanwhile, as we were parked up against the air/water station, Dylan said his bike was feeling a bit wonky and decided to check his tire pressure. Sure enough, he had a small puncture slowly leaking air out of his rear tire and his pressure was &amp;lt;20psi.

I'll be damned if that bastard had the repair kit out, and the tire plugged and refilled in about three minutes--before Scott and I had even finished our beverages. I wish we had more of a story for that incident, but the tire went from flat to fixed and full in minutes, and we were back on the road again. Kind of anti-climactic, if you ask me.

The rest of the ride home was uneventful and stress-free, thankfully. I'd forgotten how beautiful Hwy 101 was up through Humboldt and Mendocino counties. Nothing broke, and nothing was lost or stolen along the way. We stopped in Ukiah for gas and rest before our last 100 mile stretch home, and ended up chatting with a CHP officer for a while about riding for a while. We complained about not being able to legally lanesplit past the traffic jam in Portland, and the officer said &quot;you should have just done it, how would they even catch you?&quot; Lulz. They caugt my friend Jess just a couple weeks prior doing exactly that through Oregon, so evidently they have some practice at it.

Scott broke off on the bridge for home in Daly City, and Dylan and I cruised to my apartment. Julius was fairly indifferent at my arrival, but Addie was absolutely insane. He meowed endlessly and followed me around the house, and stood outside the bathroom door and cried for 20 minutes while I showered and shaved. Adorable.

Dylan and I got freshened up and walked down to DNA around 11pm to see friends, unwind and get mad crunk. A couple of Chupa drinks later and we stumbled home and passed out.

And the rest is history.

Fin.

            <column name="post_content">I'll continue to edit this list over the next few days as I think of things...

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I'd change about the route&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley, ID to Challis, ID on 75 instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;cool and worth seeing once, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight. The shortcut will save you 172 miles (230-58) of farmland and instead keep you in the twisties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hwy 2 around Glacier NP is beautiful, and should have been on the route from the getgo instead of an accidental find.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ditto for Hwy 93 up the Salmon River. Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I learned&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when setting up/taking down camp every day and stopping to see scenery and national parks. 250-350 would have been far more realistic, especially when hitting setbacks like road construction or bike/gear problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have even the slightest faint inkling that you're going to have a mechanical problem, nip it in the bud. No matter what the cost, it beats the hell out of breaking down later in BFE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don't buy RK chains. I've always run DID and my first RK chain ever (this one) died a nasty death at &amp;lt;10k. Teh suck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bullfrog clear gel sunscreen works quite well, goes on clean and dries quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Montana has some of the best (Read: Highest) speed limits in the country, and some of the slowest god damned drivers. 55 in a 70 zone? Seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Portland is a great town. The rest of Oregon can shove off into the ocean and take its speed limits and &quot;Mini-Serve&quot; gas stations with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Thing's I'm adding to my gear list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0O7_3o3BrI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brawndo's got what plants crave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trail mix, cliff bars and beef jerky. That shit is expensive on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of those gaytarded head-lamp flashlights with the elastic strap that goes around your noggin. They look ridiculous, but it would have made setting up camp MUCH easier. Just don't wear it when you're not actually setting up a tent on the moon in total darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A small spray bottle of leather cleaner/conditioner to get the bugs off my duds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tried and true suggestions for other riders on trips like this&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go out an buy the tire plug kit and 12v compressor mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this South Bay Riders thread&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, go buy it NOW, don't even wait for your next trip. They're that good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a good camp pad to sleep on, preferably inflatable or self-inflating. They keep you comfortable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warm by keeping you off the ground. No brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply ample Gold Bond powder to your arse, legs and nether regions before a long, hot ride. It seriously helps with chafing, &quot;monkey butt&quot; and general discomfort. Don't waste your money on &quot;Monkey Butt Powder&quot;, Gold Bond does the job and is dirt cheap at any drug store.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can, carry at least one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmespot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SPOT GPS Messenger&lt;/a&gt; in your group. It makes it far easier for friends and loved ones make sure you're still alive and kicking, ensures you can get emergency help even in the remotest parts of the world, and gives you a cool file full of waypoints to download and dream about when you get home. We had decent cell phone reception about 1% of the time on this trip, if that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <column name="post_content">We woke up fairly early on Saturday morning. We were having a great time on this trip, but 8 1/2 days of solid riding and sleeping on the ground is quite a bit--we were exhausted and ready to be home.

I'd been waiting quite a while for the opportunity to ride Hwy 96 along the Klamath River. The north end starts just south of the Oregon border, so it's not an easy road to ride in just a weekend. The road that it meets on its southern end in Willow Creek (Hwy 299) follows the Trinity River and is one of my all-time favorite roads--I try to ride it at least two or three times a year.

We left the campground around 9:15, and my chain was drooping lower than ever. Given that my adjuster screws had hit their limit a day or two prior, I didn't have much choice but to grin and bear it. The previous day's ride was almost entirely freeway riding down I-5 and it hadn't given me too much grief, probably due to the (relatively) constant speed and throttle of freeway riding compared to being on back roads.

As we rolled out of the campground, the chain it was still making quite a clatter upon deceleration (when the slack bunches up it was slapping against the swingarm), so I asked Dylan to lead and I rode third behind Scott. With iffy acceleration and no engine breaking at my disposal, I really didn't want to rail through the hills.

From our Saturday starting point just outside Yreka, was 152 miles to Willow Creek, an additional 47 or so to Eureka, followed by 270 back to San Francisco--at almost 500 miles, it was going to be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; day.

Barely twenty or thirty miles into Hwy 96, we hit smoke. It was heavy smoke, and getting heavier by the mile. I didn't remember hearing about any major fires on this side of I-5 (most were in the Sierra foothills), but this was evidently a doozy. We rode through some manner of smoke for at least forty or fifty miles, and at its thickest I could barely see the river a few hundred feet below the road. My eyes were burning, my nose was burning, and my chain was not cooperating.

Once the smoke started to clear a bit (about half way to Willow Creek), we stopped for a break at a gravel clearing along the river. We hydrated and micturated as needed, and I picked and inhaled a big handful of blackberries from the acres of bushes nearby...not necessarily in that order. At this point, my chain was misbehaving on deceleration &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; acceleration, and I was having a hell of a time feathering the clutch just to get over the smallest of hills. I still thought that, once we got to 101, I could limp her home and deal with the chain in the comfort of my own garage, with myriad tools and motorcycle shop parts counters at my disposal.

We saddled back up and plodded on, but another 20 or 30 miles passed and my chain was getting exponentially worse with every passing mile. By now it was clattering constantly, at every speed and throttle position, and my concern level went from from &quot;this seriously sucks&quot; to &quot;this is seriously dangerous&quot; like a light switch.

Dylan and Deeter were far ahead of me (as I was plodding along and feathering the clutch constantly at 30mph in a 55 zone that could be taken safely at 75). After I comitted the ultimate ego-suicide and waved a big, slow Harley past me, I think that Scott got an inkling that something was wrong and slowed down until he was right in front of me. I waved at him to pull over, parked the bike and got off.

I put on one of the nitrex gloves I'd brought and tugged at the chain--sure enough, it was loose enough that it could have &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; jumped the sprocket and destroyed my bike and/or me in the process. I decided that I'd be lucky to make it the last 30 or 40 miles to Willow Creek, let alone another 47 to Eureka, and that there was no way I'd make it back to San Francisco on this chain.

Scott and I decided that he should run ahead and catch Dylan and send him back to escort me as far as I could go. Since Scott had a Blackberry (the internet phone, not the type I'd been picking earlier), he was going to race ahead to Eureka and start making phone calls to motorcycle shops he could find. I was looking for (in this order): [1] A shop with a service department that could swap my chain for me, [2] A gear/parts shop that could sell me a new chain with a clip-style master link I could mount myself in a parking lot, or [3] a clip-style master link, a hacksaw and a nail, so I could knock out a few links with Deeter's rubber tent-stake mallet and clip the shitty chain back together just to get home.

At that point, I'd have been happy with some bailing wire or a handful of paperclips that I could string together and wrap around my sprockets. A few phone calls found a Honda dealership just south of us in Eureka that had a Western Powersports (a.k.a. generic crap) 530 chain in 120 links for $98. I didn't know what kind of master link it had, and I would have to find a way to kick out the 8 extra links, but I figured I'd deal with that at the shop.

I left Deeter and Dylan to have lunch at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostcoast.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lost Coast Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that I could get a new chain while they were eating and not cause much more of a delay than I already had. As I putted down 101 through downtown Eureka, feathering/burning out the clutch like I'd been doing for the past 200 miles, I passed a Kawasaki/KTM dealership on the left that I didn't find via Google earlier.

I decided to stop and see what they had, just for good measure. I walked up to the parts counter and asked if they had any 530 O or X-ring chains on the shelf. The parts guy walked into the back room and came out with a DID O-Ring chain.

&quot;We have this one, how many links do you need?&quot;

&quot;112&quot;

&quot;This one's a 112.&quot;

&quot;Awesome. What kind of master link, clip or rivet?&quot;

He opened up the box and it was a rivet-style master link. I asked if they had a rivet press tool I could borrow to put it on my bike, and explained that I was 300 miles from home on the tail end of a 3,000 mile ride. He asked if I wanted to buy one but I already own one, so so he asked his service guy if he could put the chain on for me, which he promptly did in about 20 minutes. $169 out-the-door for parts and service, barely $20 more than I would have paid at home to put the chain on myself. I called Scott and made it back to Lost Coast while they were still waiting for the check. Perfect. Kick-ass. High-5.

The three of us took off again down 101 and cruised about 50 miles to Miranda, CA to get gas. I sucked down a Red Bull and some of Dylan's copious trail mix, since I'd skipped lunch to get the new chain. Meanwhile, as we were parked up against the air/water station, Dylan said his bike was feeling a bit wonky and decided to check his tire pressure. Sure enough, he had a small puncture slowly leaking air out of his rear tire and his pressure was &amp;lt;20psi.

I'll be damned if that bastard had the repair kit out, and the tire plugged and refilled in about three minutes--before Scott and I had even finished our beverages. I wish we had more of a story for that incident, but the tire went from flat to fixed and full in minutes, and we were back on the road again. Kind of anti-climactic, if you ask me.

The rest of the ride home was uneventful and stress-free, thankfully. I'd forgotten how beautiful Hwy 101 was up through Humboldt and Mendocino counties. Nothing broke, and nothing was lost or stolen along the way. We stopped in Ukiah for gas and rest before our last 100 mile stretch home, and ended up chatting with a CHP officer about riding for a while. We complained about not being able to legally lanesplit past the traffic jam in Portland, and the officer said &quot;you should have just done it, how would they even catch you?&quot; Lulz. They caught my friend Jess just a couple weeks prior doing exactly that through Oregon, so evidently they have some practice at it.

Scott broke off on the bridge for home in Daly City, and Dylan and I cruised to my apartment. Julius was fairly indifferent at my arrival, but Addie was absolutely insane. He meowed endlessly and followed me around the house, and stood outside the bathroom door and cried for 20 minutes while I showered and shaved. Adorable.

Dylan and I got freshened up and walked down to DNA around 11pm to see friends, unwind and get mad crunk, yo. A couple of Chupa drinks later and we stumbled home and passed out.

And the rest is history.

Fin.

            <column name="post_content">We woke up fairly early on Saturday morning. We were having a great time on this trip, but 8 1/2 days of solid riding and sleeping on the ground is quite a bit--we were exhausted and ready to be home.

I'd been waiting quite a while for the opportunity to ride Hwy 96 along the Klamath River. The north end starts just south of the Oregon border, so it's not an easy road to ride in just a weekend. The road that it meets on its southern end in Willow Creek (Hwy 299) follows the Trinity River and is one of my all-time favorite roads--I try to ride it at least two or three times a year.

We left the campground around 9:15, and my chain was drooping lower than ever. Given that my adjuster screws had hit their limit a day or two prior, I didn't have much choice but to grin and bear it. The previous day's ride was almost entirely freeway riding down I-5 and it hadn't given me too much grief, probably due to the (relatively) constant speed and throttle of freeway riding compared to being on back roads.

As we rolled out of the campground, the chain it was still making quite a clatter upon deceleration (when the slack bunches up it was slapping the swingarm), so I asked Dylan to lead and I rode third behind Scott. With iffy acceleration and no engine breaking at my disposal, I really didn't want to rail through the hills.

From our Saturday starting point just outside Yreka, was 152 miles to Willow Creek, an additional 47 or so to Eureka, followed by 270 back to San Francisco--at almost 500 miles it was going to be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; day.

Barely twenty or thirty miles into Hwy 96, we hit smoke. It was heavy smoke, and getting heavier by the mile. I didn't remember hearing about any major fires on this side of I-5 (most were in the Sierras), but this was evidently a doozy. We rode through some manner of smoke for at least forty or fifty miles, and at its thickest I could barely see the river a few hundred feet below the road. My eyes were burning, my nose was burning, and my chain was not cooperating.

Once the smoke started to clear a bit (about half way to Willow Creek), we stopped for a break at a gravel clearing along the river. We hydrated and micturated as needed, and I picked and inhaled a big handful of blackberries from the acres of bushes nearby...not necessarily in that order. At this point, my chain was misbehaving on deceleration &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; acceleration, and I was having a hell of a time feathering the clutch just to get over the smallest of hills. Still, I thought that once we got to 101 I could limp her home and deal with the chain in the comfort of my own garage, with myriad tools and motorcycle shop parts counters at my disposal.

We saddled back up and plodded on, but another 20 or 30 miles passed and my chain was getting exponentially worse with every passing mile. By now it was clattering constantly, at every speed and throttle position, and my concern level went from from &quot;this seriously sucks&quot; to &quot;this is seriously dangerous&quot; like a light switch.

Dylan and Deeter were far ahead of me (as I was plodding along and feathering the clutch constantly at 30mph in a 55 zone that could be taken safely at 75). After I comitted the ultimate ego-suicide and waved a big, slow Harley past me, I think that Scott got an inkling that something was wrong and slowed down until he was right in front of me. I waved at him to pull over, parked the bike and got off.

I put on one of the nitrex gloves I'd brought and tugged at the chain--sure enough, it was loose enough that it could have &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; jumped the sprocket and destroyed my bike and/or me in the process. I decided that I'd be lucky to make it the last 30 or 40 miles to Willow Creek, let alone another 47 to Eureka, and that there was no way I'd make it back to San Francisco on this chain.

Scott and I decided that he should run ahead and catch Dylan and send him back to escort me as far as I could go. Since Scott had a Blackberry (the internet phone, not the type I'd been picking earlier), he was going to race ahead to Eureka and start making phone calls to motorcycle shops he could find. I was looking for (in this order): [1] A shop with a service department that could swap my chain for me, [2] A gear/parts shop that could sell me a new chain with a clip-style master link I could mount myself in a parking lot, or [3] a clip-style master link, a hacksaw and a nail, so I could knock out a few links with Deeter's rubber tent-stake mallet and clip the shitty chain back together just to get home.

At that point, I'd have been happy with some bailing wire or a handful of paperclips that I could string together and wrap around my sprockets. A few phone calls found a Honda dealership just south of us in Eureka that had a Western Powersports (a.k.a. generic crap) 530 chain in 120 links for $98. I didn't know what kind of master link it had, and I would have to find a way to kick out the 8 extra links, but I figured I'd deal with that at the shop.

I left Deeter and Dylan to have lunch at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostcoast.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lost Coast Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that I could get a new chain while they were eating and not cause much more of a delay than I already had. As I putted down 101 through downtown Eureka, feathering/burning out the clutch like I'd been doing for the past 200 miles, I passed a Kawasaki/KTM dealership on the left that I didn't find via Google earlier.

I decided to stop and see what they had, just for good measure. I walked up to the parts counter and asked if they had any 530 O or X-ring chains on the shelf. The parts guy walked into the back room and came out with a DID O-Ring chain.

&quot;We have this one, how many links do you need?&quot;

&quot;112&quot;

&quot;This one's a 112.&quot;

&quot;Awesome. What kind of master link, clip or rivet?&quot;

He opened up the box and it was a rivet-style master link. I asked if they had a rivet press tool I could borrow to put it on my bike, and explained that I was 300 miles from home on the tail end of a 3,000 mile ride. He asked if I wanted to buy one but I already own one, so so he asked his service guy if he could put the chain on for me, which he promptly did in about 20 minutes. $169 out-the-door for parts and service, barely $20 more than I would have paid at home to put the chain on myself. I called Scott and made it back to Lost Coast while they were still waiting for the check. Perfect. Kick-ass. High-5.

The three of us took off again down 101 and cruised about 50 miles to Miranda, CA to get gas. I sucked down a Red Bull and some of Dylan's copious trail mix, since I'd skipped lunch to get the new chain. Meanwhile, as we were parked up against the air/water station, Dylan said his bike was feeling a bit wonky and decided to check his tire pressure. Sure enough, he had a small puncture slowly leaking air out of his rear tire and his pressure was &amp;lt;20psi.

I'll be damned if that bastard had the repair kit out, and the tire plugged and refilled in about three minutes--before Scott and I had even finished our beverages. I wish we had more of a story for that incident, but the tire went from flat to fixed and full in minutes, and we were back on the road again. Kind of anti-climactic, if you ask me.

The rest of the ride home was uneventful and stress-free, thankfully. I'd forgotten how beautiful Hwy 101 was up through Humboldt and Mendocino counties. Nothing broke, and nothing was lost or stolen along the way. We stopped in Ukiah for gas and rest before our last 100 mile stretch home, and ended up chatting with a CHP officer about riding for a while. We complained about not being able to legally lanesplit past the traffic jam in Portland, and the officer said &quot;you should have just done it, how would they even catch you?&quot; Lulz. They caught my friend Jess just a couple weeks prior doing exactly that through Oregon, so evidently they have some practice at it.

Scott broke off on the bridge for home in Daly City, and Dylan and I cruised to my apartment. Julius was fairly indifferent at my arrival, but Addie was absolutely insane. He meowed endlessly and followed me around the house, and stood outside the bathroom door and cried for 20 minutes while I showered and shaved. Adorable.

Dylan and I got freshened up and walked down to DNA around 11pm to see friends, unwind and get mad crunk, yo. A couple of Chupa drinks later and we stumbled home and passed out.

And the rest is history.

Fin.

            <column name="post_content">Thursday's ride was fairly uneventful. Cutting out the two mountains in Washington, we rode down into Oregon via Hwy 12 and Walla Walla.

Somewhere in Oregon we were stopped at a yet another road construction zone, but this time the cute blonde flagperson waved us up to the front of the pack and let us know that we had 10-15 minutes to take off our helmets, rest and chat with her before traffic would be let through.

Eventually we met up with the Columbia River and stopped in Boardman, OR for some agonizingly slow Bozo Burgers (a.k.a. bacon cheeseburgers anywhere else in the universe). Scott got stuck behind a family of 2500 while trying to order his food, including one old man who wrote a personal check for $8.50 to cover his meal, and another old man who inquired if their chili was homemade before taking 10 minutes to haggle and waffle over sundae toppings.

The ride along the Columbia River Gorge was beautiful, but probably would have been a lot more awe-inspiring had we not just come from some of the most beautiful stretches of road in the world.

We eventually hit Portland and got stuck in a hefty traffic jam, which turned out to be the aftermath of a motorcycle accident. An older, small sportbike that was rattlecanned black was being loaded off the road. I thought it was an EX500, but Scott said it looks like a Hurricane.

After some time gritting our teeth while not being able to lanesplit, we made it downtown and pulled off at a parking lot next to the convention center to call our respective friends. We were looking for a place to get a cheap motel room and be able to walk to food and booze. Scott's friend Josh suggested one quarter of town, my friend Jan suggested a different part of town, and Dylan's friend (with whom he was staying) lived in a completely different part of town.

I ended up calling Thatch to break the tie, and Scott and I got a room at 10th and Burnside right across the street from Union Jack's (strip club), the Doug Fir (hipster bar), and next door to the Galaxy Restaurant &amp;amp; Lounge, complete with cheap drinks, decent chinese food, and horrible karaoke.

After a few beers at the Doug Fir (and breaking a half-full pint glass all over Josh's messenger bag about 8 seconds after meeting him), we moseyed across the street to meet Dylan and his friends Melissa and Erin at the Galaxy. A few more drinks, some pot stickers, and some atrocious singing chased us over to Union Jack's.

Surprisingly, the drinks were bar-priced and not strip-club-priced, as is apparently the norm in Portland. Jan and Erin went their separate ways, and the rest of us spent a couple of hours drinking and talking. A stripper lit Melissa's cigarette off her nipple (the stripper's, not Melissa's) using a paper match, some saliva and a little yankee ingenuity. Good times.

Eventually Dylan and Melissa took off, then Josh took off, then Scott and I stumbled across the street to our motel room to pass the hell out. We're going to need to get back to Portland again.

            <column name="post_content">Things I'd change about the route:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley to Challis, ID instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was very cool, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Things I learned:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when camping and stopping to see stuff. 250-350 would have been far more realistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Thing's I'm adding to my motorcycle trip list:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because Brawndo has what plants crave.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I'd change about the route&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley, ID to Challis, ID instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was very cool, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hwy 2 around Glacier NP is beautiful, and should have been on the route from the getgo instead of an accidental find. Ditto for Hwy 93 up the Salmon River. Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I learned&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when setting up/taking down camp every day and stopping to see scenery and national parks. 250-350 would have been far more realistic, especially when hitting setbacks like road construction or bike/gear problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have even the slightest faint inkling that you're going to have a mechanical problem, nip it in the bud. No matter what the cost, it beats the hell out of breaking down later in BFE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don't buy RK chains. I've always run DID and my first RK chain ever (this one) died a nasty death at &amp;lt;10k. Teh suck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bullfrog clear gel sunscreen works quite well, goes on clean and dries quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Montana has some of the best (Read: Highest) speed limits in the country, and some of the slowest god damned drivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Thing's I'm adding to my gear list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because Brawndo has what plants crave.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trail mix, cliff bars and beef jerky. That shit is expensive on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of those gaytarded head-lamp flashlights with the elastic strap that goes around your noggin. They look ridiculous, but it would have made setting up camp MUCH easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tried and true suggestions for other riders on trips like this&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go out an buy the tire plug kit and 12v compressor mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this South Bay Riders thread&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, go buy it NOW, don't even wait for your next trip. They're that good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a good camp pad to sleep on, preferably inflatable or self-inflating. They keep you comfortable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warm by keeping you off the ground. No brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can, carry at least one SPOT GPS Messenger in your group. It makes it far easier for friends and loved ones make sure you're still alive and kicking, ensures you can get emergency help even in the remotest parts of the world, and gives you a cool file full of waypoints to download and dream about when you get home.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply ample Gold Bond powder to your arse, legs and nether regions before a long, hot ride. It seriously helps with chafing, &quot;monkey butt&quot; and general discomfort. Don't waste your money on &quot;Monkey Butt Powder&quot;, Gold Bond does the job and is dirt cheap at any drug store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <column name="post_content">I'll continue to edit this list over the next few days as I think of things...

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I'd change about the route&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley, ID to Challis, ID instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was very cool, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hwy 2 around Glacier NP is beautiful, and should have been on the route from the getgo instead of an accidental find. Ditto for Hwy 93 up the Salmon River. Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I learned&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when setting up/taking down camp every day and stopping to see scenery and national parks. 250-350 would have been far more realistic, especially when hitting setbacks like road construction or bike/gear problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have even the slightest faint inkling that you're going to have a mechanical problem, nip it in the bud. No matter what the cost, it beats the hell out of breaking down later in BFE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don't buy RK chains. I've always run DID and my first RK chain ever (this one) died a nasty death at &amp;lt;10k. Teh suck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bullfrog clear gel sunscreen works quite well, goes on clean and dries quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Montana has some of the best (Read: Highest) speed limits in the country, and some of the slowest god damned drivers. 55 in a 70 zone? Seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Thing's I'm adding to my gear list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because Brawndo has what plants crave.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trail mix, cliff bars and beef jerky. That shit is expensive on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of those gaytarded head-lamp flashlights with the elastic strap that goes around your noggin. They look ridiculous, but it would have made setting up camp MUCH easier. Just don't wear it when you're not actually setting up a tent on the moon in total darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tried and true suggestions for other riders on trips like this&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go out an buy the tire plug kit and 12v compressor mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this South Bay Riders thread&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, go buy it NOW, don't even wait for your next trip. They're that good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a good camp pad to sleep on, preferably inflatable or self-inflating. They keep you comfortable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warm by keeping you off the ground. No brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply ample Gold Bond powder to your arse, legs and nether regions before a long, hot ride. It seriously helps with chafing, &quot;monkey butt&quot; and general discomfort. Don't waste your money on &quot;Monkey Butt Powder&quot;, Gold Bond does the job and is dirt cheap at any drug store.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can, carry at least one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmespot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SPOT GPS Messenger&lt;/a&gt; in your group. It makes it far easier for friends and loved ones make sure you're still alive and kicking, ensures you can get emergency help even in the remotest parts of the world, and gives you a cool file full of waypoints to download and dream about when you get home. We had decent cell phone reception about 1% of the time on this trip, if that.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I'd change about the route&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley, ID to Challis, ID on 75 instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;cool and worth seeing once, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight. The shortcut will save you 172 miles (230-58) of farmland and instead keep you in the twisties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hwy 2 around Glacier NP is beautiful, and should have been on the route from the getgo instead of an accidental find.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ditto for Hwy 93 up the Salmon River. Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I learned&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when setting up/taking down camp every day and stopping to see scenery and national parks. 250-350 would have been far more realistic, especially when hitting setbacks like road construction or bike/gear problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have even the slightest faint inkling that you're going to have a mechanical problem, nip it in the bud. No matter what the cost, it beats the hell out of breaking down later in BFE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don't buy RK chains. I've always run DID and my first RK chain ever (this one) died a nasty death at &amp;lt;10k. Teh suck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bullfrog clear gel sunscreen works quite well, goes on clean and dries quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Montana has some of the best (Read: Highest) speed limits in the country, and some of the slowest god damned drivers. 55 in a 70 zone? Seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Portland is a great town. The rest of Oregon can shove off into the ocean and take its speed limits and &quot;Mini-Serve&quot; gas stations with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Thing's I'm adding to my gear list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because Brawndo has what plants crave.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trail mix, cliff bars and beef jerky. That shit is expensive on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of those gaytarded head-lamp flashlights with the elastic strap that goes around your noggin. They look ridiculous, but it would have made setting up camp MUCH easier. Just don't wear it when you're not actually setting up a tent on the moon in total darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tried and true suggestions for other riders on trips like this&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go out an buy the tire plug kit and 12v compressor mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this South Bay Riders thread&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, go buy it NOW, don't even wait for your next trip. They're that good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a good camp pad to sleep on, preferably inflatable or self-inflating. They keep you comfortable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warm by keeping you off the ground. No brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply ample Gold Bond powder to your arse, legs and nether regions before a long, hot ride. It seriously helps with chafing, &quot;monkey butt&quot; and general discomfort. Don't waste your money on &quot;Monkey Butt Powder&quot;, Gold Bond does the job and is dirt cheap at any drug store.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can, carry at least one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmespot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SPOT GPS Messenger&lt;/a&gt; in your group. It makes it far easier for friends and loved ones make sure you're still alive and kicking, ensures you can get emergency help even in the remotest parts of the world, and gives you a cool file full of waypoints to download and dream about when you get home. We had decent cell phone reception about 1% of the time on this trip, if that.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I'd change about the route&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley, ID to Challis, ID on 75 instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;cool and worth seeing once, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight. The shortcut will save you 172 miles (230-58) of farmland and instead keep you in the twisties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hwy 2 around Glacier NP is beautiful, and should have been on the route from the getgo instead of an accidental find.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ditto for Hwy 93 up the Salmon River. Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I learned&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when setting up/taking down camp every day and stopping to see scenery and national parks. 250-350 would have been far more realistic, especially when hitting setbacks like road construction or bike/gear problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have even the slightest faint inkling that you're going to have a mechanical problem, nip it in the bud. No matter what the cost, it beats the hell out of breaking down later in BFE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don't buy RK chains. I've always run DID and my first RK chain ever (this one) died a nasty death at &amp;lt;10k. Teh suck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bullfrog clear gel sunscreen works quite well, goes on clean and dries quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Montana has some of the best (Read: Highest) speed limits in the country, and some of the slowest god damned drivers. 55 in a 70 zone? Seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Thing's I'm adding to my gear list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because Brawndo has what plants crave.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trail mix, cliff bars and beef jerky. That shit is expensive on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of those gaytarded head-lamp flashlights with the elastic strap that goes around your noggin. They look ridiculous, but it would have made setting up camp MUCH easier. Just don't wear it when you're not actually setting up a tent on the moon in total darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tried and true suggestions for other riders on trips like this&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go out an buy the tire plug kit and 12v compressor mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this South Bay Riders thread&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, go buy it NOW, don't even wait for your next trip. They're that good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a good camp pad to sleep on, preferably inflatable or self-inflating. They keep you comfortable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warm by keeping you off the ground. No brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply ample Gold Bond powder to your arse, legs and nether regions before a long, hot ride. It seriously helps with chafing, &quot;monkey butt&quot; and general discomfort. Don't waste your money on &quot;Monkey Butt Powder&quot;, Gold Bond does the job and is dirt cheap at any drug store.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can, carry at least one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmespot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SPOT GPS Messenger&lt;/a&gt; in your group. It makes it far easier for friends and loved ones make sure you're still alive and kicking, ensures you can get emergency help even in the remotest parts of the world, and gives you a cool file full of waypoints to download and dream about when you get home. We had decent cell phone reception about 1% of the time on this trip, if that.&lt;/li&gt;

            <column name="post_content">In the morning, we rolled out of our Grinding Rock campsite and up Hwy 88 over Carson Pass, stopping for lunch in Kirkwood along the way. After lunch we rolled over the pass and down into Nevada, stopping for gas and refreshments outside Carson City, and taking a picture of the enormous moth that would be an omen for the insect storm to come.

We didnâ€™t want to take 80 via Reno because 395 between Carson City and Reno are nothing but extreme heat, stop-and-go traffic and exhaust fumes. Instead, my route had us taking Hwy 50 from Carson City all the way out to Fallon, but on the fly I decided to cut up to 80 at Fernley, which turned out to be a good idea.

Once we hit the 75mph speed limit on 80, we made very good time to Winnemucca. The ride was straight, flat, and hot as blazes as expected, but at least we were burning miles quickly. Unfortunately, we were also burning daylight quickly and, as we took 95 up into eastern Oregon, we watched the sun quickly setting to our left.

At our next gas stop we had to make a command decision. We had some Hot Springs deeper in Oregon recommended by one friend, and a campground on the border recommended by another, but it was apparent that we weren't going to come close to making either by nightfall, so we opted to ride into the night and just get a motel room outside Boise to make up the time and mileage we lost on Friday night.

We rode well into the night, being as paranoid as possible about animals on the road, and sailing through an absolutely insane monsoon of insects along the Oregon/Idaho border. We stopped for dinner at a Shari's (the only thing that was open) on the outskirts of Boise and I went ahead and made the first potato joke of the week, commenting on how incredibly fresh Shari's waffle-cut fries were.

We ended up settling in at a Motel 6 on the other end of Boise (by the airport) and sleeping like logs.

            <column name="post_content">I'll continue to edit this list over the next few days as I think of things...

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I'd change about the route&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley, ID to Challis, ID on 75 instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;cool and worth seeing once, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight. The shortcut will save you 172 miles (230-58) of farmland and instead keep you in the twisties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hwy 2 around Glacier NP is beautiful, and should have been on the route from the getgo instead of an accidental find.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ditto for Hwy 93 up the Salmon River. Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I learned&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when setting up/taking down camp every day and stopping to see scenery and national parks. 250-350 would have been far more realistic, especially when hitting setbacks like road construction or bike/gear problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have even the slightest faint inkling that you're going to have a mechanical problem, nip it in the bud. No matter what the cost, it beats the hell out of breaking down later in BFE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don't buy RK chains. I've always run DID and my first RK chain ever (this one) died a nasty death at &amp;lt;10k. Teh suck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bullfrog clear gel sunscreen works quite well, goes on clean and dries quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Montana has some of the best (Read: Highest) speed limits in the country, and some of the slowest god damned drivers. 55 in a 70 zone? Seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Portland is a great town. The rest of Oregon can shove off into the ocean and take its speed limits and &quot;Mini-Serve&quot; gas stations with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Thing's I'm adding to my gear list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0O7_3o3BrI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brawndo's got what plants crave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trail mix, cliff bars and beef jerky. That shit is expensive on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of those gaytarded head-lamp flashlights with the elastic strap that goes around your noggin. They look ridiculous, but it would have made setting up camp MUCH easier. Just don't wear it when you're not actually setting up a tent on the moon in total darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tried and true suggestions for other riders on trips like this&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go out an buy the tire plug kit and 12v compressor mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this South Bay Riders thread&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, go buy it NOW, don't even wait for your next trip. They're that good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a good camp pad to sleep on, preferably inflatable or self-inflating. They keep you comfortable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warm by keeping you off the ground. No brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply ample Gold Bond powder to your arse, legs and nether regions before a long, hot ride. It seriously helps with chafing, &quot;monkey butt&quot; and general discomfort. Don't waste your money on &quot;Monkey Butt Powder&quot;, Gold Bond does the job and is dirt cheap at any drug store.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can, carry at least one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmespot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SPOT GPS Messenger&lt;/a&gt; in your group. It makes it far easier for friends and loved ones make sure you're still alive and kicking, ensures you can get emergency help even in the remotest parts of the world, and gives you a cool file full of waypoints to download and dream about when you get home. We had decent cell phone reception about 1% of the time on this trip, if that.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I'd change about the route&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley, ID to Challis, ID on 75 instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;cool and worth seeing once, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight. The shortcut will save you 172 miles (230-58) of farmland and instead keep you in the twisties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hwy 2 around Glacier NP is beautiful, and should have been on the route from the getgo instead of an accidental find.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ditto for Hwy 93 up the Salmon River. Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I learned&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when setting up/taking down camp every day and stopping to see scenery and national parks. 250-350 would have been far more realistic, especially when hitting setbacks like road construction or bike/gear problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have even the slightest faint inkling that you're going to have a mechanical problem, nip it in the bud. No matter what the cost, it beats the hell out of breaking down later in BFE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don't buy RK chains. I've always run DID and my first RK chain ever (this one) died a nasty death at &amp;lt;10k. Teh suck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bullfrog clear gel sunscreen works quite well, goes on clean and dries quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Montana has some of the best (Read: Highest) speed limits in the country, and some of the slowest god damned drivers. 55 in a 70 zone? Seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Portland is a great town. The rest of Oregon can shove off into the ocean and take its speed limits and &quot;Mini-Serve&quot; gas stations with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Thing's I'm adding to my gear list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0O7_3o3BrI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brawndo's got what plants crave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trail mix, cliff bars and beef jerky. That shit is expensive on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of those gaytarded head-lamp flashlights with the elastic strap that goes around your noggin. They look ridiculous, but it would have made setting up camp MUCH easier. Just don't wear it when you're not actually setting up a tent on the moon in total darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tried and true suggestions for other riders on trips like this&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go out an buy the tire plug kit and 12v compressor mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this South Bay Riders thread&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, go buy it NOW, don't even wait for your next trip. They're that good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a good camp pad to sleep on, preferably inflatable or self-inflating. They keep you comfortable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warm by keeping you off the ground. No brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply ample Gold Bond powder to your arse, legs and nether regions before a long, hot ride. It seriously helps with chafing, &quot;monkey butt&quot; and general discomfort. Don't waste your money on &quot;Monkey Butt Powder&quot;, Gold Bond does the job and is dirt cheap at any drug store.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can, carry at least one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmespot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SPOT GPS Messenger&lt;/a&gt; in your group. It makes it far easier for friends and loved ones make sure you're still alive and kicking, ensures you can get emergency help even in the remotest parts of the world, and gives you a cool file full of waypoints to download and dream about when you get home. We had decent cell phone reception about 1% of the time on this trip, if that.&lt;/li&gt;

            <column name="post_content">I'll continue to edit this list over the next few days as I think of things...

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I'd change about the route&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut over from Stanley, ID to Challis, ID on 75 instead of riding all the way down to 20. Craters on the Moon NP was &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;cool and worth seeing once, but southern Idaho in general is very flat and straight. The shortcut will save you 172 miles (230-58) of farmland and instead keep you in the twisties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hwy 2 around Glacier NP is beautiful, and should have been on the route from the getgo instead of an accidental find.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ditto for Hwy 93 up the Salmon River. Epic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Things I learned&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;400 miles per day is too ambitious, especially when setting up/taking down camp every day and stopping to see scenery and national parks. 250-350 would have been far more realistic, especially when hitting setbacks like road construction or bike/gear problems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have even the slightest faint inkling that you're going to have a mechanical problem, nip it in the bud. No matter what the cost, it beats the hell out of breaking down later in BFE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don't buy RK chains. I've always run DID and my first RK chain ever (this one) died a nasty death at &amp;lt;10k. Teh suck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bullfrog clear gel sunscreen works quite well, goes on clean and dries quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Montana has some of the best (Read: Highest) speed limits in the country, and some of the slowest god damned drivers. 55 in a 70 zone? Seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Portland is a great town. The rest of Oregon can shove off into the ocean and take its speed limits and &quot;Mini-Serve&quot; gas stations with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Thing's I'm adding to my gear list&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some lightweight (but strong) twine/rope to hang my lantern (and food in campsites that don't provide bear-proof containers).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Powdered Gatorade, because campground water tastes like ass and because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0O7_3o3BrI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brawndo's got what plants crave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trail mix, cliff bars and beef jerky. That shit is expensive on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of those gaytarded head-lamp flashlights with the elastic strap that goes around your noggin. They look ridiculous, but it would have made setting up camp MUCH easier. Just don't wear it when you're not actually setting up a tent on the moon in total darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A small spray bottle of leather cleaner/conditioner to get the bugs off my duds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Tried and true suggestions for other riders on trips like this&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go out an buy the tire plug kit and 12v compressor mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this South Bay Riders thread&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, go buy it NOW, don't even wait for your next trip. They're that good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a good camp pad to sleep on, preferably inflatable or self-inflating. They keep you comfortable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; warm by keeping you off the ground. No brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply ample Gold Bond powder to your arse, legs and nether regions before a long, hot ride. It seriously helps with chafing, &quot;monkey butt&quot; and general discomfort. Don't waste your money on &quot;Monkey Butt Powder&quot;, Gold Bond does the job and is dirt cheap at any drug store.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you can, carry at least one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmespot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SPOT GPS Messenger&lt;/a&gt; in your group. It makes it far easier for friends and loved ones make sure you're still alive and kicking, ensures you can get emergency help even in the remotest parts of the world, and gives you a cool file full of waypoints to download and dream about when you get home. We had decent cell phone reception about 1% of the time on this trip, if that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I'm looking to upgrade to a pair of F4i forks, any year will do (as far as I can tell, all model years of the F4i are 43mm RSU cartridge forks). I don't need the triples, steering stem, wheel, axle, etc., just the forks alone as long as they are straight, don't leak and are in overall decent shape.

I also need an F4i front fender, but it's not as high a priority--I can find cheap fenders all over the place.

If you have a pair of forks you can part with, please to email ziad at wackyiraqi dawt kalm.</column>

            <column name="post_content">My police report from Volvo Fight 2008â„¢ finally arrived in the mail today, and I was found NOT at fault. The careless douche in the Volvo was from Davis, CA and the reporting officer's conclusion on page 8 cites the cause of the collision as an unsafe u-turn per CVC 22105.

I was fairly sure this was exactly what the report would say, but it's still a huge relief to see it all in writing:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wackyiraqi.com/moto/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/sfpd_censored.pdf&quot;&gt;SFPD Traffic Collision Report&lt;/a&gt;

Now to contact his insurance company (AAA), get a damage estimate, and replace my bent forks.</column>

            <column name="post_content">Josh and I rolled over to the Chevron at 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;amp; Harrison to meet Henry and Jason around 8:30am. After some coffee and gas station snacks, we putted over to Oakland to meet Rhonda. From there the five of us had a flat, uneventful ride to beautiful Oakdale, where we stopped for gas and a break.
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Joshâ€™s bike was bogging down at 7k RPM and he was worried that his charging system was shot again, so he picked up a multi-meter at the hardware store next to the gas station. The various voltage levels seemed fine, but he was blowing a ton of oil out of one gasket or another, so he topped off and we all continued on to Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After paying our $10 entrance fees, we took a scenic but agonizingly slow ride through the park, stopping at Olmsted Point to gawk at the view. As we continued along Tioga Road and saw a large BARF group taking a break at Tuolumne meadows. We stopped to chat for a few minutes, then continued on to Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We took our last gas stop in Lee Vining, then proceeded to scream across highway 167, a 60 mile stretch of one the straightest, flattest, middle-of-nowherest roads Iâ€™ve ever been on. Once we got a few miles in, I rolled on the throttle and screamed passed some of the BARF riders ahead of us, slowing a bit as I crested the occasional hill and staring intently at the rare oncoming cars in the distance to try and avoid the minute chance an epic speeding ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Cruising along at triple-digits, eventually another bike popped up in my mirrors and soon Jason blew by me on his Daytona 675. Shortly thereafter, another headlight appeared in my mirror, and Josh caught up to me on his 25 year-old, oil-spewing rat bike. We all slowed down back down to the speed limit and regrouped as we approached the booming metropolis of Hawthorne, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We rolled into the El Capitan Lodge to check in. I checked in and gave up our non-smoking room to a BARFer in front of me who looked like he was going to blow a gasket when he was told that all they had was smoking rooms left despite his reservation. It was no huge deal to us, and our smoking room turned out to smell far less like a rancid ashtray than some of the non-smoking rooms our friends had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After a quick change, we headed over to the casino and met up with some friends. Melissa bought us a round of beers, and then a group of us headed across the street for pizza where Rhonda was nice enough to buy us all dinner, and then over to Joeâ€™s Tavern for a thousand 50Â¢ Budweisers. Dave rode up as we were eating outside, and Jon called from Merced and eventually rolled into town around 10:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Memo to Self: Bring own pool cue on next trip to Hawthorne. I hate to be the guy showing up with a pool cue because I'm not good enough to, but I hate square tips even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average speed in Yosemite NP: &lt;/strong&gt;45mph&lt;strong&gt;
Top speed in Yosemite NP:&lt;/strong&gt; 45mph&lt;strong&gt;

            <column name="post_content">After some Advil and coffee to counteract the 1000 beers from the night before, a few of us congregated and decided to break from the official BARF destination schedule and ride to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodie.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bodie State Historical Park&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday instead of on the way home Sunday. That way, we could take our time and spend most of the day milling around the old ghost town instead of worrying about having to get home.

Rather than burning more daylight with a long meal in town, our group (now Jon, Josh, Steve and Henry and me) rode to Lee Vining for a quick bite at the much-hyped Mobile station restaurant. Josh and Jon both ordered food, and were not impressed. I just had a handful of trail mix and one of those Toll House cookie ice cream sandwiches.

After food, we rolled up 395 to 270 and rode the 9 miles on pavement, and an additional 3 miles on hard, rutted dirt road to the ghost town. Somewhere along the bumpy dirt stretch my water bottle flew off the back of my bike, but Steve stopped and picked it up for me.

We left most of our gear on our bikes and spent a few hours walking around the ghost town. The buildings and furniture, appliances and trinkets inside of them were fascinating and we all took scores of photos as we walked around what's left of the town.

When we were done in Bodie, we decided to ride up to a barbecue joint in Walker, but decided instead to go for barbecue in Lee Vining because Jon's rear tire was in its death throes and really didn't need the extra 100 miles. Steve graciously bought us all dinner at Bodie Mike's in Lee Vining, and we all screamed back across 167 to Hawthorne for another 1000 dirt-cheap piss beers.

When we arrived back at the hotel we realized that we'd completely spaced on the big group dinner for the evening, but we ended up hanging out, shooting pool, and drinking with a gaggle of BARF folks at Joe's after they were done eating.

Oh, on the ride out on 167 in the morning I broke my land-speed record on the Hornet (set a couple of years ago on Highway 25 at 137mph) with 138.6 mph on the GPS, or a little over 150 indicated on the speedometer.

            <column name="post_content">After some Advil and coffee to counteract the 1000 beers from the night before, a few of us congregated and decided to break from the official BARF destination schedule and ride to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodie.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bodie State Historical Park&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday instead of on the way home Sunday. That way, we could take our time and spend most of the day milling around the old ghost town instead of worrying about having to get home.

Rather than burning more daylight with a long meal in town, our group (now Jon, Josh, Steve and Henry and me) rode to Lee Vining for a quick bite at the much-hyped Mobile station restaurant. After food, we rolled up 395 to 270 and rode the 9 miles on pavement, and an additional 3 miles on hard, rutted dirt road to the ghost town. Somewhere along the bumpy dirt stretch my water bottle flew off the back of my bike, but Steve stopped and picked it up for me.

We left most of our gear on our bikes and spent a few hours walking around the ghost town. The buildings and furniture, appliances and trinkets inside of them were fascinating and we all took scores of photos as we walked around what's left of the town.

When we were done in Bodie, we decided to ride up to a barbecue joint in Walker, but decided instead to go for barbecue in Lee Vining because Jon's rear tire was in its death throes and really didn't need the extra 100 miles. Steve graciously bought us all dinner at Bodie Mike's in Lee Vining, and we all screamed back across 167 to Hawthorne for another night of dirt-cheap piss beer.

When we arrived back at the hotel we realized that we'd completely spaced on the big group dinner for the evening, but we ended up hanging out, shooting pool, and drinking with a gaggle of BARF folks at Joe's after they were done eating.

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Josh and I rolled over to the Chevron at 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;amp; Harrison to meet Henry and Jason around 8:30am. After some coffee and gas station snacks, we rolled over to Oakland to meet Rhonda. From there we had a flat, uneventful ride to beautiful Oakdale, where we stopped for gas and a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Joshâ€™s bike was bogging down and he was worried that his charging system was shot again, so he picked up a multi-meter at the hardware store next to the gas station. The various voltage levels seemed fine, but he was blowing a ton of oil out of one gasket or another, so he topped off and we all continued on to Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After paying our $10 entrance fees, we took a scenic but very slow ride through the park, stopping at Olmsted Point to stare at the view. As we continued along Tioga Road and saw a large BARF group taking a break at Tuolumne meadows. We stopped to chat for a few minutes, then continued on to Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We took our last gas stop in Lee Vining, then proceeded to scream across highway 167, a 60 mile stretch of one the straightest, flattest, middle-of-nowherest roads Iâ€™ve ever been on. Once we got a few miles in, I rolled on the throttle and screamed passed some of the BARF riders ahead of us, slowing a bit as I crested the occasional hill and staring intently at the rare oncoming cars in the distance to try and avoid the minute chance an epic speeding ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Cruising along at triple-digits, eventually another bike popped up in my mirrors and soon Jason blew by me on his Daytona 675. Shortly thereafter, another headlight appeared in my mirror, and Josh caught up to me on his 25 year-old, oil-spewing rat. We all slowed down back down to the speed limit and regrouped as we approached the booming metropolis of Hawthorne, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We rolled into the El Capitan Lodge to check in. I checked in and gave up our non-smoking room to a BARFer in front of me who looked like he was going to blow a gasket when he was told that all they had was smoking rooms left despite his reservation. It was no huge deal to us, and our smoking room turned out to smell far less like a rancid ashtray than some of the non-smoking rooms our friends had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After a quick change, we headed over to the casino and met up with some friends. Melissa bought us a round of beers, and then a group of us headed acover to Joeâ€™s Tavern across the street for a thousand 50 cent Budweisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average speed in Yosemite NP: &lt;/strong&gt;45mph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top speed in Yosemite NP:&lt;/strong&gt; 45mph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average speed on Hwy 167:&lt;/strong&gt; 110mph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Josh and I rolled over to the Chevron at 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;amp; Harrison to meet Henry and Jason around 8:30am. After some coffee and gas station snacks, we rolled over to Oakland to meet Rhonda. From there we had a flat, uneventful ride to beautiful Oakdale, where we stopped for gas and a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Joshâ€™s bike was bogging down and he was worried that his charging system was shot again, so he picked up a multi-meter at the hardware store next to the gas station. The various voltage levels seemed fine, but he was blowing a ton of oil out of one gasket or another, so he topped off and we all continued on to Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After paying our $10 entrance fees, we took a scenic but very slow ride through the park, stopping at Olmsted Point to stare at the view. As we continued along Tioga Road and saw a large BARF group taking a break at Tuolumne meadows. We stopped to chat for a few minutes, then continued on to Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We took our last gas stop in Lee Vining, then proceeded to scream across highway 167, a 60 mile stretch of one the straightest, flattest, middle-of-nowherest roads Iâ€™ve ever been on. Once we got a few miles in, I rolled on the throttle and screamed passed some of the BARF riders ahead of us, slowing a bit as I crested the occasional hill and staring intently at the rare oncoming cars in the distance to try and avoid the minute chance an epic speeding ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Cruising along at triple-digits, eventually another bike popped up in my mirrors and soon Jason blew by me on his Daytona 675. Shortly thereafter, another headlight appeared in my mirror, and Josh caught up to me on his 25 year-old, oil-spewing rat. We all slowed down back down to the speed limit and regrouped as we approached the booming metropolis of Hawthorne, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We rolled into the El Capitan Lodge to check in. I checked in and gave up our non-smoking room to a BARFer in front of me who looked like he was going to blow a gasket when he was told that all they had was smoking rooms left despite his reservation. It was no huge deal to us, and our smoking room turned out to smell far less like a rancid ashtray than some of the non-smoking rooms our friends had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After a quick change, we headed over to the casino and met up with some friends. Melissa bought us a round of beers, and then a group of us headed across the street for pizza, and then over to Joeâ€™s Tavern for a thousand 50Â¢ Budweisers. Dave rolled up as we were eating, and Jon called from Merced and eventually rolled into town around 10:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Josh and I rolled over to the Chevron at 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;amp; Harrison to meet Henry and Jason around 8:30am. After some coffee and gas station snacks, we rolled over to Oakland to meet Rhonda. From there we had a flat, uneventful ride to beautiful Oakdale, where we stopped for gas and a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Joshâ€™s bike was bogging down and he was worried that his charging system was shot again, so he picked up a multi-meter at the hardware store next to the gas station. The various voltage levels seemed fine, but he was blowing a ton of oil out of one gasket or another, so he topped off and we all continued on to Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After paying our $10 entrance fees, we took a scenic but very slow ride through the park, stopping at Olmsted Point to stare at the view. As we continued along Tioga Road and saw a large BARF group taking a break at Tuolumne meadows. We stopped to chat for a few minutes, then continued on to Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We took our last gas stop in Lee Vining, then proceeded to scream across highway 167, a 60 mile stretch of one the straightest, flattest, middle-of-nowherest roads Iâ€™ve ever been on. Once we got a few miles in, I rolled on the throttle and screamed passed some of the BARF riders ahead of us, slowing a bit as I crested the occasional hill and staring intently at the rare oncoming cars in the distance to try and avoid the minute chance an epic speeding ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Cruising along at triple-digits, eventually another bike popped up in my mirrors and soon Jason blew by me on his Daytona 675. Shortly thereafter, another headlight appeared in my mirror, and Josh caught up to me on his 25 year-old, oil-spewing rat. We all slowed down back down to the speed limit and regrouped as we approached the booming metropolis of Hawthorne, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We rolled into the El Capitan Lodge to check in. I checked in and gave up our non-smoking room to a BARFer in front of me who looked like he was going to blow a gasket when he was told that all they had was smoking rooms left despite his reservation. It was no huge deal to us, and our smoking room turned out to smell far less like a rancid ashtray than some of the non-smoking rooms our friends had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After a quick change, we headed over to the casino and met up with some friends. Melissa bought us a round of beers, and then a group of us headed across the street for pizza, and then over to Joeâ€™s Tavern for a thousand 50Â¢ Budweisers. Dave rolled up as we were eating, and Jon called from Merced and eventually rolled into town around 10:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Josh and I rolled over to the Chevron at 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;amp; Harrison to meet Henry and Jason around 8:30am. After some coffee and gas station snacks, we rolled over to Oakland to meet Rhonda. From there we had a flat, uneventful ride to beautiful Oakdale, where we stopped for gas and a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Joshâ€™s bike was bogging down and he was worried that his charging system was shot again, so he picked up a multi-meter at the hardware store next to the gas station. The various voltage levels seemed fine, but he was blowing a ton of oil out of one gasket or another, so he topped off and we all continued on to Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After paying our $10 entrance fees, we took a scenic but very slow ride through the park, stopping at Olmsted Point to stare at the view. As we continued along Tioga Road and saw a large BARF group taking a break at Tuolumne meadows. We stopped to chat for a few minutes, then continued on to Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We took our last gas stop in Lee Vining, then proceeded to scream across highway 167, a 60 mile stretch of one the straightest, flattest, middle-of-nowherest roads Iâ€™ve ever been on. Once we got a few miles in, I rolled on the throttle and screamed passed some of the BARF riders ahead of us, slowing a bit as I crested the occasional hill and staring intently at the rare oncoming cars in the distance to try and avoid the minute chance an epic speeding ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Cruising along at triple-digits, eventually another bike popped up in my mirrors and soon Jason blew by me on his Daytona 675. Shortly thereafter, another headlight appeared in my mirror, and Josh caught up to me on his 25 year-old, oil-spewing rat. We all slowed down back down to the speed limit and regrouped as we approached the booming metropolis of Hawthorne, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We rolled into the El Capitan Lodge to check in. I checked in and gave up our non-smoking room to a BARFer in front of me who looked like he was going to blow a gasket when he was told that all they had was smoking rooms left despite his reservation. It was no huge deal to us, and our smoking room turned out to smell far less like a rancid ashtray than some of the non-smoking rooms our friends had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After a quick change, we headed over to the casino and met up with some friends. Melissa bought us a round of beers, and then a group of us headed across the street for pizza, and then over to Joeâ€™s Tavern for a thousand 50Â¢ Budweisers. Dave rolled up as we were eating, and Jon called from Merced and eventually rolled into town around 10:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <column name="post_content">After some Advil and coffee to counteract the 1000 beers from the night before, a few of us congregated and decided to break from the official BARF destination schedule and ride to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodie.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bodie State Historical Park&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday instead of on the way home Sunday. That way, we could take our time and spend most of the day milling around the old ghost town instead of worrying about having to get home.

Rather than burning more daylight with a long meal in town, our group (now Jon, Josh, Steve and Henry and me) rode to Lee Vining for a quick bite at the much-hyped Mobile station restaurant. After food, we rolled up 395 to 270 and rode the 9 miles on pavement, and an additional 3 miles on hard, rutted dirt road to the ghost town. Somewhere along the bumpy dirt stretch my water bottle flew off the back of my bike, but Steve stopped and picked it up for me.

We left most of our gear on our bikes and spent a few hours walking around the ghost town. The buildings and furniture, appliances and trinkets inside of them were fascinating and we all took scores of photos as we walked around what's left of the town.

When we were done in Bodie, we decided to ride up to a barbecue joint in Walker, but decided instead to go for barbecue in Lee Vining because Jon's rear tire was in its death throes and really didn't need the extra 100 miles. Steve graciously bought us all dinner at Bodie Mike's in Lee Vining, and we all screamed back across 167 to Hawthorne for another night of dirt-cheap piss beer.

When we arrived back at the hotel we realized that we'd completely spaced on the big group dinner for the evening, but we ended up hanging out, shooting pool, and drinking with a gaggle of BARF folks at Joe's after they were done eating.

            <column name="post_content">I woke up a bit hungover at 8am, took a shower, got dressed in street clothes, and then put in my earphones and promptly fell back asleep until about 10am. Jon and Josh eventually got up, and we packed up and checked out at the crack of noon. We ate a thoroughly disappointing breakfast of Huevos Rancheros (evidently Spanish for &quot;fried egg with crap salsa thrown on&quot;) at Jack's Mexican-American food in Hawthorne, then gassed up and hit the road. I got my Huevos Rancheros and ate it despite the fact that I'd actually ordered Huevos con Chorizo (evidently Spanish for &quot;also Huevos Rancheros&quot;).

Jon's rear tire was toast (though still no cords showing through) and Josh's bike was still vomiting up a ton of oil, but they kept an eye on both as we rode back home. We took 167 to 395, then rode up to 108 over the Sierras. Sonora Pass was stunning--the scenery was gorgeous and the road was amazingly twisty and well groomed. We had to pass quite a few idiots in SUVs and RVs, but made decent time over the mountains to stop in Dardanelle for a break.

There we ran into Frank from BARF/SBR who was on a large group ride that was unrelated to the rally. We took off a few seconds after they all did, but immediately got a helmet-tap from the riders ahead of us. I was leading our small group of three, and we were putting along at about 40mph (in a 55mph zone) behind another couple of riders.

Eventually I got fed up and passed them, only to approach another five or six riders from their group also putting along at 40-45mph. A few hundred feet in front of them was a Highway Patrol SUV (hence the helmet-taps) tailgating a solo rider from their big group who appeared to be doing well under the speed limit. After several agonizingly slow miles, the solo rider pulled off the road at a campground and let the CHP unit pass him. We continued on behind the slow-moving group for a few more miles, not knowing how far ahead the CHP had gone.

Jon got tired of waiting and blew past all of us, only to almost catch up to the CHP truck a few turns ahead. He slowed down to the speed limit and waved me past him, and the cop finally pulled off the road at the next town, after what seemed like twelve days behind him.

The rest of the ride was fairly uneventful, and blazing hot through the valley. Jon broke off towards 5 in Oakdale, and Josh broke off in Oakland to see a friend. I got home, showered, grilled a couple of pork chops out of the freezer, and passed the hell out with my cats on top of me.

            <column name="post_content">I woke up a bit hungover at 8am, took a shower, got dressed in street clothes, and then put in my earphones and promptly fell back asleep until about 10am. Jon and Josh eventually got up, and we packed up and checked out at the crack of noon. We ate a thoroughly disappointing breakfast of Huevos Rancheros (evidently Spanish for &quot;fried egg with crap salsa thrown on&quot;) at Jack's Mexican-American food in Hawthorne, then gassed up and hit the road. I got my Huevos Rancheros and ate it despite the fact that I'd actually ordered Huevos con Chorizo (evidently Spanish for &quot;also Huevos Rancheros&quot;).

Jon's rear tire was toast (though still no cords showing through) and Josh's bike was still vomiting up a ton of oil, but they kept an eye on both as we rode back home. We took 167 to 395, then rode up to 108 over the Sierras. Sonora Pass was stunning--the scenery was gorgeous and the road was amazingly twisty and well groomed. We had to pass quite a few idiots in SUVs and RVs, but made decent time over the mountains to stop in Dardanelle for a break.

There we ran into Frank from BARF/SBR who was on a large group ride that was unrelated to the rally. We took off a few seconds after they all did, but immediately got a helmet-tap from the riders ahead of us. I was leading our small group of three, and we were putting along at about 40mph (in a 55mph zone) behind another couple of riders.

Eventually I got fed up and passed them, only to approach another five or six riders from their group also putting along at 40-45mph. A few hundred feet in front of them was a Highway Patrol SUV (hence the helmet-taps) tailgating a solo rider from their big group who appeared to be doing well under the speed limit. After several agonizingly slow miles, the solo rider pulled off the road at a campground and let the CHP unit pass him.

            <column name="post_content">I woke up a bit hungover at 8am, took a shower, got dressed in street clothes, and then put in my earphones and promptly fell back asleep until about 10am. Jon and Josh eventually got up, and we packed up and checked out at the crack of noon. We ate a thoroughly disappointing breakfast of Huevos Rancheros (evidently Spanish for &quot;fried egg with crap salsa thrown on&quot;) at Jack's Mexican-American food in Hawthorne, then gassed up and hit the road. I got my Huevos Rancheros and ate it despite the fact that I'd actually ordered Huevos con Chorizo (evidently Spanish for &quot;also Huevos Rancheros&quot;).

Jon's rear tire was toast (though still no cords showing through) and Josh's bike was still vomiting up a ton of oil, but they kept an eye on both as we rode back home. We took 167 to 395, then rode up to 108 over the Sierras. Sonora Pass was stunning--the scenery was gorgeous and the road was amazingly twisty and well groomed. We had to pass quite a few idiots in SUVs and RVs, but made decent time over the mountains to stop in Dardanelle for a break.

There we ran into Frank from BARF/SBR who was on a large group ride that was unrelated to the rally. We took off a few seconds after they all did, but immediately got a helmet-tap from the riders ahead of us. I was leading our small group of three, and we were putting along at about 40mph (in a 55mph zone) behind another couple of riders.

Eventually I got fed up and passed them, only to approach another five or six riders from their group also putting along at 40-45mph. A few hundred feet in front of them was a Highway Patrol SUV (hence the helmet-taps) tailgating a solo rider from their big group who appeared to be doing well under the speed limit. After several agonizingly slow miles, the solo rider pulled off the road at a campground and let the CHP unit pass him. We continued on behind the slow-moving group for a few more miles, not knowing how far ahead the CHP had gone.

Jon got tired of waiting and blew past all of us, only to almost catch up to the CHP truck a few turns ahead. He slowed down to the speed limit and waved me past him, and the cop finally pulled off the road at the next town, after what seemed like twelve days behind him.

The rest of the ride was fairly uneventful, and blazing hot through the valley. Jon broke off towards 5 in Oakdale, and Josh broke off in Oakland to see a friend. I got home, showered, grilled a couple of pork chops out of the freezer, and passed the hell out with my cats on top of me.

Josh and I rolled over to the Chevron at 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;amp; Harrison to meet Henry and Jason around 8:30am. After some coffee and gas station snacks, we rolled over to Oakland to meet Rhonda. From there we had a flat, uneventful ride to beautiful Oakdale, where we stopped for gas and a break.
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Joshâ€™s bike was bogging down and he was worried that his charging system was shot again, so he picked up a multi-meter at the hardware store next to the gas station. The various voltage levels seemed fine, but he was blowing a ton of oil out of one gasket or another, so he topped off and we all continued on to Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After paying our $10 entrance fees, we took a scenic but very slow ride through the park, stopping at Olmsted Point to stare at the view. As we continued along Tioga Road and saw a large BARF group taking a break at Tuolumne meadows. We stopped to chat for a few minutes, then continued on to Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We took our last gas stop in Lee Vining, then proceeded to scream across highway 167, a 60 mile stretch of one the straightest, flattest, middle-of-nowherest roads Iâ€™ve ever been on. Once we got a few miles in, I rolled on the throttle and screamed passed some of the BARF riders ahead of us, slowing a bit as I crested the occasional hill and staring intently at the rare oncoming cars in the distance to try and avoid the minute chance an epic speeding ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Cruising along at triple-digits, eventually another bike popped up in my mirrors and soon Jason blew by me on his Daytona 675. Shortly thereafter, another headlight appeared in my mirror, and Josh caught up to me on his 25 year-old, oil-spewing rat. We all slowed down back down to the speed limit and regrouped as we approached the booming metropolis of Hawthorne, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We rolled into the El Capitan Lodge to check in. I checked in and gave up our non-smoking room to a BARFer in front of me who looked like he was going to blow a gasket when he was told that all they had was smoking rooms left despite his reservation. It was no huge deal to us, and our smoking room turned out to smell far less like a rancid ashtray than some of the non-smoking rooms our friends had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After a quick change, we headed over to the casino and met up with some friends. Melissa bought us a round of beers, and then a group of us headed across the street for pizza, and then over to Joeâ€™s Tavern for a thousand 50Â¢ Budweisers. Dave rolled up as we were eating, and Jon called from Merced and eventually rolled into town around 10:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

            <column name="post_content">After some Advil and coffee to counteract the 1000 beers from the night before, a few of us congregated and decided to break from the official BARF destination schedule and ride to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodie.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bodie State Historical Park&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday instead of on the way home Sunday. That way, we could take our time and spend most of the day milling around the old ghost town instead of worrying about having to get home.

Rather than burning more daylight with a long meal in town, our group (now Jon, Josh, Steve and Henry and me) rode to Lee Vining for a quick bite at the much-hyped Mobile station restaurant. After food, we rolled up 395 to 270 and rode the 9 miles on pavement, and an additional 3 miles on hard, rutted dirt road to the ghost town. Somewhere along the bumpy dirt stretch my water bottle flew off the back of my bike, but Steve stopped and picked it up for me.

We left most of our gear on our bikes and spent a few hours walking around the ghost town. The buildings and furniture, appliances and trinkets inside of them were fascinating and we all took scores of photos as we walked around what's left of the town.

When we were done in Bodie, we decided to ride up to a barbecue joint in Walker, but decided instead to go for barbecue in Lee Vining because Jon's rear tire was in its death throes and really didn't need the extra 100 miles. Steve graciously bought us all dinner at Bodie Mike's in Lee Vining, and we all screamed back across 167 to Hawthorne for another 1000 dirt-cheap piss beers.

When we arrived back at the hotel we realized that we'd completely spaced on the big group dinner for the evening, but we ended up hanging out, shooting pool, and drinking with a gaggle of BARF folks at Joe's after they were done eating.

Oh, on the ride out on 167 in the morning I broke my land-speed record on the Hornet (set a couple of years ago on Highway 25 at 137mph) with 138.6 mph on the GPS, or a little over 150 indicated on the speedometer.

            <column name="post_content">I woke up a bit hungover at 8am, took a shower, got dressed in street clothes, and then put in my earphones and promptly fell back asleep until about 10am. Jon and Josh eventually got up, and we packed up and checked out at the crack of noon. We ate a thoroughly disappointing breakfast of Huevos Rancheros (evidently Spanish for &quot;fried egg with crap salsa thrown on&quot;) at Jack's Mexican-American food in Hawthorne, then gassed up and hit the road. I got my Huevos Rancheros and ate it despite the fact that I'd actually ordered Huevos con Chorizo (evidently Spanish for &quot;also Huevos Rancheros&quot;).

Jon's rear tire was toast (though still no cords showing through) and Josh's bike was still vomiting up a ton of oil, but they kept an eye on both as we rode back home. We took 167 to 395, then rode up to 108 over the Sierras. Sonora Pass was stunning--the scenery was gorgeous and the road was amazingly twisty and well groomed. We had to pass quite a few idiots in SUVs and RVs, but made decent time over the mountains to stop in Dardanelle for a break.

There we ran into Frank from BARF/SBR who was on a large group ride that was unrelated to the rally. We took off a few seconds after they all did, but immediately got a helmet-tap from the riders ahead of us. I was leading our small group of three, and we were putting along at about 40mph (in a 55mph zone) behind another couple of riders.

Eventually I got fed up and passed them, only to approach another five or six riders from their group also putting along at 40-45mph. A few hundred feet in front of them was a Highway Patrol SUV (hence the helmet-taps) tailgating a solo rider from their big group who appeared to be doing well under the speed limit. After several agonizingly slow miles, the solo rider pulled off the road at a campground and let the CHP unit pass him. We continued on behind the slow-moving group for a few more miles, not knowing how far ahead the CHP had gone.

Jon got tired of waiting and blew past all of us, only to almost catch up to the CHP truck a few turns ahead. He slowed down to the speed limit and waved me past him, and the cop finally pulled off the road at the next town, after what seemed like twelve days behind him.

The rest of the ride was fairly uneventful, and blazing hot through the valley. Jon broke off towards 5 in Oakdale, and Josh broke off in Oakland to see a friend. I got home, showered, grilled a couple of pork chops out of the freezer, and passed the hell out with my cats on top of me.

After some coffee and gas station snacks, we putted over to Oakland to meet Rhonda. From there the five of us had a flat, uneventful ride to beautiful Oakdale, where we stopped for gas and a break.
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Joshâ€™s bike was bogging down and he was worried that his charging system was shot again, so he picked up a multi-meter at the hardware store next to the gas station. The various voltage levels seemed fine, but he was blowing a ton of oil out of one gasket or another, so he topped off and we all continued on to Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After paying our $10 entrance fees, we took a scenic but agonizingly slow ride through the park, stopping at Olmsted Point to gawk at the view.

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We took our last gas stop in Lee Vining, then proceeded to scream across highway 167, a 60 mile stretch of one the straightest, flattest, middle-of-nowherest roads Iâ€™ve ever been on. Once we got a few miles in, I rolled on the throttle and screamed passed some of the BARF riders ahead of us, slowing a bit as I crested the occasional hill and staring intently at the rare oncoming cars in the distance to try and avoid the minute chance an epic speeding ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Cruising along at triple-digits, eventually another bike popped up in my mirrors and soon Jason blew by me on his Daytona 675. Shortly thereafter, another headlight appeared in my mirror, and Josh caught up to me on his 25 year-old, oil-spewing rat bike. We all slowed down back down to the speed limit and regrouped as we approached the booming metropolis of Hawthorne, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We rolled into the El Capitan Lodge to check in. I checked in and gave up our non-smoking room to a BARFer in front of me who looked like he was going to blow a gasket when he was told that all they had was smoking rooms left despite his reservation. It was no huge deal to us, and our smoking room turned out to smell far less like a rancid ashtray than some of the non-smoking rooms our friends had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After a quick change, we headed over to the casino and met up with some friends. Melissa bought us a round of beers, and then a group of us headed across the street for pizza where Rhonda bought us all dinner, and then over to Joeâ€™s Tavern for a thousand 50Â¢ Budweisers. Dave rode up as we were eating outside, and Jon called from Merced and eventually rolled into town around 10:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

            <column name="post_content">After some Advil and coffee to counteract the 1000 beers from the night before, a few of us congregated and decided to break from the official BARF destination schedule and ride to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodie.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bodie State Historical Park&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday instead of on the way home Sunday. That way, we could take our time and spend most of the day milling around the old ghost town instead of worrying about having to get home.

Rather than burning more daylight with a long meal in town, our group (now Jon, Josh, Steve and Henry and me) rode to Lee Vining for a quick bite at the much-hyped Mobile station restaurant. Josh and Jon both ordered food, and were not impressed. I just had a handful of trail mix and one of those Toll House cookie ice cream sandwiches.

After food, we rolled up 395 to 270 and rode the 9 miles on pavement, and an additional 3 miles on hard, rutted dirt road to the ghost town. Somewhere along the bumpy dirt stretch my water bottle flew off the back of my bike, but Steve stopped and picked it up for me.

We left most of our gear on our bikes and spent a few hours walking around the ghost town. The buildings and furniture, appliances and trinkets inside of them were fascinating and we all took scores of photos as we walked around what's left of the town.

When we were done in Bodie, we decided to ride up to a barbecue joint in Walker, but decided instead to go for barbecue in Lee Vining because Jon's rear tire was in its death throes and really didn't need the extra 100 miles. Steve graciously bought us all dinner at Bodie Mike's in Lee Vining, and we all screamed back across 167 to Hawthorne for another 1000 dirt-cheap piss beers.

When we arrived back at the hotel we realized that we'd completely spaced on the big group dinner for the evening, but we ended up hanging out, shooting pool, and drinking with a gaggle of BARF folks at Joe's after they were done eating.

Oh, on the ride out on 167 in the morning I broke my land-speed record on the Hornet (set a couple of years ago on Highway 25 at 137mph) with 138.6 mph on the GPS, or a little over 150 indicated on the speedometer.

&lt;span id=&quot;articlebody&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(09-15) 18:41 PDT &lt;/strong&gt; -- Papa's final ride was a Viking funeral, his body borne to his final resting place by a river of chrome and thunder.&lt;/span&gt;

Mark &quot;Papa&quot; Guardado, 46, was killed Sept. 2 outside a Mission District bar. At the time, he was president of the Frisco Hells Angels, royalty of the outlaw biker realm. He was shot to death, police say, by Christopher Ablett, 37, of Modesto, a member of the rival Mongols Motorcycle Club, whose bad blood with the Hells Angels goes back in history. Ablett is still being sought.

But there was little talk of the Mongols as the Hells Angels gathered to remember Guardado at a vigil Sunday night and funeral Monday morning; little more than a passing, irritated reference to a Sonoma County prosecutor who had charges pending against Guardado stemming from a bar fight and who called him a dangerous gang member with an assault conviction on his record.

Instead, those gathered remembered their Guardado, the friend or surrogate father, the man who many said bought them their first Harley-Davidson - or helped them get the job they needed to buy their own.

&quot;To me, and everyone that knew him, he was the epitome of Hells Angels,&quot; said Richard Goldammer, who rode from his home in British Columbia to honor the man he called his mentor.

&quot;He set an example for a lot of people, being straight up, honest and respectful to everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;People form their own opinion about our club ... we are who we are. We stand in our own social circle.&quot;

It is a circle with many intersecting rings that pulled together in Daly City for what many hailed as an event of unprecedented scale.

Well over 1,000 motorcyclists gathered at Duggan's Serra Mortuary for the two-day memorial: Hells Angels chapters from Alaska to Maine, from Rhode Island to Hawaii, and from overseas - Norway, Germany, England, Australia, Italy and more.

And not just Hells Angels showed up. Duggan's parking lot hosted a collection of motorcycle clubs rarely seen outside events in Hollister or Sturgis, S.D., - the Mecca and Medina of biker culture. &lt;strong&gt;Top Hatters and Henchmen, Vampires and Devil Dolls, representatives of large groups and small, they all slapped leather-clad shoulders and shared tears and tales of Papa Guadardo, or just exchanged stories from the road.&lt;/strong&gt;

Overall, despite the continuous rumble of motorcycles arriving and departing, the farewell to Guardado was as quiet and thoughtful as any funeral. Police expected and reported few incidents. A few beers and flasks were raised in the assemblage, but most drank water and soda or coffee as they waited and mourned.

As the vigil began Sunday evening, mourners packed the main room at Duggan's and several smaller rooms, where they watched on closed circuit television. Huge, grizzled men wept as one of their number sang Willie Nelson's &quot;Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground,&quot; accompanying himself on saxophone.

An emotional pastor described Guardado as a friendly, supportive man, a good son, father, uncle and godfather whose independent streak began with a runaway attempt as a 5-year-old. He described Guardado's good acts - donning a Santa hat to take gifts to children in the hospital at Christmas, or to children whose fathers were in prison; taking food left over after club events to feed the homeless.

&quot;When you do right they never remember,&quot; the pastor said. &quot;When you do wrong they never forget.&quot;

The vigil ended with Guardado's goddaughter singing Alicia Keys' &quot;Prelude to a Kiss.&quot;

&lt;em&gt;&quot;It's a long long way to heaven&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;But I gotta get there&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Can you send me an angel to guide me?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The caravan escorting Guardado's coffin to Colma's Cypress Lawn Cemetery on Monday morning went by way of San Francisco's Mission District, a river of thunder that flowed through the urban canyons for more than an hour. The caravan didn't stop for signals; it set its own speed limit. Some onlookers waved, some took pictures, some pressed hands to ears and waited for the end. And for a brief period on Interstate 280, as police halted all other freeway traffic, the mourners took over the roads.

They buried Papa not too far from where former Daly City Hells Angels President Harry &quot;The Horse&quot; Flamburis is buried with his motorcycle. The Frisco Hells Angels and a sea of red-and-white-clad others formed a close group around Guardado's grave. A few words were spoken as a biker on the outskirts cranked Metallica's somber ode &quot;Nothing Else Matters.&quot;

The ceremony over, the Angels picked up shovels and buried their leader. Then they returned to their motorcycles and roared away.

&lt;span id=&quot;articlebody&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(09-15) 18:41 PDT &lt;/strong&gt; -- Papa's final ride was a Viking funeral, his body borne to his final resting place by a river of chrome and thunder.

Mark &quot;Papa&quot; Guardado, 46, was killed Sept. 2 outside a Mission District bar. At the time, he was president of the Frisco Hells Angels, royalty of the outlaw biker realm. He was shot to death, police say, by Christopher Ablett, 37, of Modesto, a member of the rival Mongols Motorcycle Club, whose bad blood with the Hells Angels goes back in history. Ablett is still being sought.

But there was little talk of the Mongols as the Hells Angels gathered to remember Guardado at a vigil Sunday night and funeral Monday morning; little more than a passing, irritated reference to a Sonoma County prosecutor who had charges pending against Guardado stemming from a bar fight and who called him a dangerous gang member with an assault conviction on his record.

Instead, those gathered remembered their Guardado, the friend or surrogate father, the man who many said bought them their first Harley-Davidson - or helped them get the job they needed to buy their own.

&quot;To me, and everyone that knew him, he was the epitome of Hells Angels,&quot; said Richard Goldammer, who rode from his home in British Columbia to honor the man he called his mentor.

&quot;He set an example for a lot of people, being straight up, honest and respectful to everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;People form their own opinion about our club ... we are who we are. We stand in our own social circle.&quot;

It is a circle with many intersecting rings that pulled together in Daly City for what many hailed as an event of unprecedented scale.

Well over 1,000 motorcyclists gathered at Duggan's Serra Mortuary for the two-day memorial: Hells Angels chapters from Alaska to Maine, from Rhode Island to Hawaii, and from overseas - Norway, Germany, England, Australia, Italy and more.

And not just Hells Angels showed up. Duggan's parking lot hosted a collection of motorcycle clubs rarely seen outside events in Hollister or Sturgis, S.D., - the Mecca and Medina of biker culture. Top Hatters and Henchmen, Vampires and Devil Dolls, representatives of large groups and small, they all slapped leather-clad shoulders and shared tears and tales of Papa Guadardo, or just exchanged stories from the road.

Overall, despite the continuous rumble of motorcycles arriving and departing, the farewell to Guardado was as quiet and thoughtful as any funeral. Police expected and reported few incidents. A few beers and flasks were raised in the assemblage, but most drank water and soda or coffee as they waited and mourned.

As the vigil began Sunday evening, mourners packed the main room at Duggan's and several smaller rooms, where they watched on closed circuit television. Huge, grizzled men wept as one of their number sang Willie Nelson's &quot;Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground,&quot; accompanying himself on saxophone.

&quot;When you do right they never remember,&quot; the pastor said. &quot;When you do wrong they never forget.&quot;

The vigil ended with Guardado's goddaughter singing Alicia Keys' &quot;Prelude to a Kiss.&quot;

&lt;em&gt;&quot;It's a long long way to heaven&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;But I gotta get there&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Can you send me an angel to guide me?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;articlebody&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(09-15) 18:41 PDT &lt;/strong&gt; -- Papa's final ride was a Viking funeral, his body borne to his final resting place by a river of chrome and thunder.&lt;/span&gt;

Mark &quot;Papa&quot; Guardado, 46, was killed Sept. 2 outside a Mission District bar. At the time, he was president of the Frisco Hells Angels, royalty of the outlaw biker realm. He was shot to death, police say, by Christopher Ablett, 37, of Modesto, a member of the rival Mongols Motorcycle Club, whose bad blood with the Hells Angels goes back in history. Ablett is still being sought.

But there was little talk of the Mongols as the Hells Angels gathered to remember Guardado at a vigil Sunday night and funeral Monday morning; little more than a passing, irritated reference to a Sonoma County prosecutor who had charges pending against Guardado stemming from a bar fight and who called him a dangerous gang member with an assault conviction on his record.

Instead, those gathered remembered their Guardado, the friend or surrogate father, the man who many said bought them their first Harley-Davidson - or helped them get the job they needed to buy their own.

&quot;To me, and everyone that knew him, he was the epitome of Hells Angels,&quot; said Richard Goldammer, who rode from his home in British Columbia to honor the man he called his mentor.

&quot;He set an example for a lot of people, being straight up, honest and respectful to everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;People form their own opinion about our club ... we are who we are. We stand in our own social circle.&quot;

It is a circle with many intersecting rings that pulled together in Daly City for what many hailed as an event of unprecedented scale.

Well over 1,000 motorcyclists gathered at Duggan's Serra Mortuary for the two-day memorial: Hells Angels chapters from Alaska to Maine, from Rhode Island to Hawaii, and from overseas - Norway, Germany, England, Australia, Italy and more.

And not just Hells Angels showed up. Duggan's parking lot hosted a collection of motorcycle clubs rarely seen outside events in Hollister or Sturgis, S.D., - the Mecca and Medina of biker culture. Top Hatters and Henchmen, Vampires and Devil Dolls, representatives of large groups and small, they all slapped leather-clad shoulders and shared tears and tales of Papa Guadardo, or just exchanged stories from the road.

Overall, despite the continuous rumble of motorcycles arriving and departing, the farewell to Guardado was as quiet and thoughtful as any funeral. Police expected and reported few incidents. A few beers and flasks were raised in the assemblage, but most drank water and soda or coffee as they waited and mourned.

As the vigil began Sunday evening, mourners packed the main room at Duggan's and several smaller rooms, where they watched on closed circuit television. Huge, grizzled men wept as one of their number sang Willie Nelson's &quot;Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground,&quot; accompanying himself on saxophone.

An emotional pastor described Guardado as a friendly, supportive man, a good son, father, uncle and godfather whose independent streak began with a runaway attempt as a 5-year-old. He described Guardado's good acts - donning a Santa hat to take gifts to children in the hospital at Christmas, or to children whose fathers were in prison; taking food left over after club events to feed the homeless.

&quot;When you do right they never remember,&quot; the pastor said. &quot;When you do wrong they never forget.&quot;

The vigil ended with Guardado's goddaughter singing Alicia Keys' &quot;Prelude to a Kiss.&quot;

&lt;em&gt;&quot;It's a long long way to heaven&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;But I gotta get there&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Can you send me an angel to guide me?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The caravan escorting Guardado's coffin to Colma's Cypress Lawn Cemetery on Monday morning went by way of San Francisco's Mission District, a river of thunder that flowed through the urban canyons for more than an hour. The caravan didn't stop for signals; it set its own speed limit. Some onlookers waved, some took pictures, some pressed hands to ears and waited for the end. And for a brief period on Interstate 280, as police halted all other freeway traffic, the mourners took over the roads.

They buried Papa not too far from where former Daly City Hells Angels President Harry &quot;The Horse&quot; Flamburis is buried with his motorcycle. The Frisco Hells Angels and a sea of red-and-white-clad others formed a close group around Guardado's grave. A few words were spoken as a biker on the outskirts cranked Metallica's somber ode &quot;Nothing Else Matters.&quot;

The ceremony over, the Angels picked up shovels and buried their leader. Then they returned to their motorcycles and roared away.

He exhibited all the signs of a newbie with little to no experience lane splitting in heavy commute traffic: He was agonizingly slow. He continually jumped over the line between the #1 to #2 lanes (something that'll earn a rider a fat ticket). He was reluctant to split past cars when he had &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of space. He braked hard and often, then accelerated through dangerous gaps in traffic, where cars tend to jump lanes and hit motorcycles with no warning.

At this point, you're probably wondering why I didn't just move two lanes over and pass the guy and speed off into the split like any normal rider would do when confronted with a rolling road-hazard like that. That's the rub--the rider was a CHP officer, on-duty, riding his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wackyiraqi.com/moto/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/rtp-my.jpg&quot;&gt;R1150-RTP&lt;/a&gt; like a 4 year-old on his first bicycle.

The best part of the whole debacle? I arrived home, and stepped off my bike to this message on my phone from a friend who evidently saw us both pass from his car:

He exhibited all the signs of a newbie with little to no experience lane splitting in heavy commute traffic: He was agonizingly slow. He continually jumped over the line from the #1 to #2 lane (something that'll earn a rider a fat ticket) He was reluctant to split past cars when he had &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of space.

He braked hard and often, then accelerated through dangerous gaps in traffic, where cars tend to jump lanes and hit motorcycles with no warning. He lingered between cars, allowing them plenty of time to weave in their lanes and pinch him.

For the 15 or so miles that I was stuck behind him, I was fully expecting him to crash at any moment. So why didn't IÂ  just move two lanes over and pass the guy and speed off into the split like any normal rider would do when confronted with a rolling road-hazard like that? That's the rub--the rider was a CHP officer, on-duty, riding his RT1100-RTP police bike like a 4 year-old who desperately needed training wheels.</column>

At this point, you're probably wondering why I didn't just move two lanes over and pass the guy and speed off into the split like any normal rider would do when confronted with a rolling road-hazard like that. That's the rub--the rider was a CHP officer, on-duty, riding his R1150-RTP police bike like a 4 year-old on his first bicycle.

The best part of the whole debacle? I arrived home, and stepped off my bike to this message on my phone from a friend who evidently saw us both pass from his car:

He exhibited all the signs of a newbie with little to no experience lane splitting in heavy commute traffic: He was agonizingly slow. He continually jumped over the line from the #1 to #2 lane (something that'll earn a rider a fat ticket) He was reluctant to split past cars when he had &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of space. He braked hard and often, then accelerated through dangerous gaps in traffic, where cars tend to jump lanes and hit motorcycles with no warning).

At this point, you're probably wondering why I didn't just move two lanes over and pass the guy and speed off into the split like any normal rider would do when confronted with a rolling road-hazard like that. That's the rub--the rider was a CHP officer, on-duty, riding his R1150-RTP police bike like a 4 year-old on his first bicycle.

The best part of the whole debacle? I arrived home, and stepped off my bike to this message on my phone from a friend who evidently saw us both pass from his car:

            <column name="post_content">&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Lane-sharing (lane-splitting, filtering, white-lining, etc.) is currently legal in one and only state in the US: California. It's a crying shame, really, as it's not only legal but exceedingly common in just about every other country on the planet.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;But it's so dangerous! Right?!&lt;/em&gt;

Not exactly, no.

According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurt_Report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hurt Report&lt;/a&gt;, the reigning bible of motorcycle crash statistics, the risk to a rider of being hit while lane-sharing is actually &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt;than the risk of being hit while sitting in traffic with the drooling, four-wheeled masses. This is largely due to the relatively good chance of being rear-ended in stop-and-go traffic, coupled with the increased attention levels required of riders to lane-share.

With those initial few facts out of the way, and before I get into any specific tips on lane-sharing, let me first fire out this big disclaimer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm neither a teacher nor a certified instructor. I'm not an expert, per se; I don't have any fancy certificates on my wall and I've never taught any sort of organized class on motorcycling.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;What I'll be sharing are my opinions--information, tips and techniques that I've picked up from my own experiences and those I've learned from other riders over the yearsâ€”nothing more.

I have been riding motorcycles religiously for about ten years and commuting daily up and down the all-too-congested &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=San+Francisco,+CA+to+San+Jose,+CA&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=10&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Highway 101 in the San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; for about five of those years, day or night, rain or shine. As one might imagine, I have more lane-sharing miles under my belt than many riders have &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; miles. Still, you should take everything I say here with a large grain of salt, as you should the advice of any random motorcyclist who tries to dole it out.

Don't ever do anything on a motorcycle with which you're not 110% comfortable. Don't ride above your abilities. Don't believe everything you read on the internet. If it seems like a bad idea, it probably is. Never stop learning. Your mileage may vary. Void where prohibited by law. Need not be present to win. Donâ€™t chop down cherry trees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be posting some thoughts (and pretty pictures!) that will hopefully help you become a safer, more confident lane-sharererer-erer. If you don't currently split lanes, hopefully I'll be able to give you a tiny bit of knowledge and help you start slowly, carefully and safely, to live in a world without traffic jams.

            <column name="post_content">Lane-sharing (lane-splitting, filtering, white-lining, etc.) is currently legal in one and only state in the US: California. It's a crying shame, really, as it's not only legal but exceedingly commin in just about every other country on the planet.

&lt;em&gt;But it's so dangerous! Right?!&lt;/em&gt;

Wrong. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurt_Report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hurt Report&lt;/a&gt;, the reigning bible of motorcycle crash statistics, the risk to a rider of being hit while lane-sharing is actually slightly &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt; than the risk of being hit while participating in stop-and-go traffic with the drooling four-wheeled masses.

With those initial facts out of the way, let me fire out this big disclaimer: I'm not a teacher or a certified instructor. I'm not an expert, per se, at least I don't have any certificates on my wall, and I've never taught any sort of organized class on motorcycling.

I have, however, been riding motorcycles religiously for about 10 years, and commuting daily up and down the all-too-conjested &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=San+Francisco,+CA+to+San+Jose,+CA&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=10&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;highway 101 in the San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; for about 5 of those years, day or night, rain or shine. As you can imagine, I have more lane-sharing miles under my belt than many riders have &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; miles.

Still, please take everything I say with a large grain of salt, as you should from any random motorcyclist who tries to dole out unsolicited advice.Â  What I'll be typing here are my opinions and nothing more; information, tips and techniques that I've picked up from my own experiences and those I've learned from from other riders over the years.

Don't ever do anything on a motorcycle you're not 110% comfortable with. Don't ride above your abilities. Don't believe everything you read on the internet. If it seems like a bad idea, it probably is. Your mileage may vary. Void where prohibited by law. Need not be present to win.

Not exactly, no.

According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurt_Report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hurt Report&lt;/a&gt;, the reigning bible of motorcycle crash statistics, the risk to a rider of being hit while lane-sharing is actually &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt;than the risk of being hit while sitting in traffic with the drooling, four-wheeled masses. This is largely due to the relatively good chance of being rear-ended in stop-and-go traffic, coupled with the increased attention levels required of riders to lane-share.

With those initial few facts out of the way, and before I get into any specific tips on lane-sharing, let me first fire out this big disclaimer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm neither a teacher nor a certified instructor. I'm not an expert, per se; I don't have any fancy certificates on my wall and I've never taught any sort of organized class on motorcycling (or anything, really.)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;What I'll be typing are my opinions--information, tips and techniques that I've picked up from my own experiences and those I've learned from other riders over the yearsâ€”nothing more.

I have been riding motorcycles religiously for about ten years and commuting daily up and down the all-too-congested &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=San+Francisco,+CA+to+San+Jose,+CA&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=10&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Highway 101 in the San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; for about five of those years, day or night, rain or shine. As one might imagine, I have more lane-sharing miles under my belt than many riders have &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; miles. Still, you should take everything I say here with a large grain of salt, as you should the advice of any random motorcyclist who tries to dole it out unsolicited.

Don't ever do anything on a motorcycle with which you're not 110% comfortable. Don't ride above your abilities. Don't believe everything you read on the internet. If it seems like a bad idea, it probably is. Never stop learning. Your mileage may vary. Void where prohibited by law. Need not be present to win. Donâ€™t chop down cherry trees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be posting some thoughts (and pretty pictures!) that will hopefully help you become a safer, more confident lane-sharererer-erer. If you don't currently split lanes, hopefully I'll be able to give you a tiny bit of knowledge and help you start slowly, carefully and safely, to live in a world without traffic jams.

            <column name="post_content">&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Lane-sharing (lane-splitting, filtering, white-lining, etc.) is currently legal in one and only state in the US: California. It's a crying shame, really, as it's not only legal but exceedingly common in just about every other country on the planet.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;But it's so dangerous! Right?!&lt;/em&gt;

Not exactly, no.

According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurt_Report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hurt Report&lt;/a&gt;, the reigning bible of motorcycle crash statistics, the risk to a rider of being hit while lane-sharing is actually &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt;than the risk of being hit while sitting in traffic with the drooling, four-wheeled masses. This is largely due to the relatively good chance of being rear-ended in stop-and-go traffic, coupled with the increased attention levels required of riders to lane-share.

With those initial few facts out of the way, and before I get into any specific tips on lane-sharing, let me first fire out this big disclaimer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm neither a teacher nor a certified instructor. I'm not an expert, per se; I don't have any fancy certificates on my wall and I've never taught any sort of organized class on motorcycling.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;What I'll be sharing are my opinions--information, tips and techniques that I've picked up from my own experiences and those I've learned from other riders over the yearsâ€”nothing more.

I have been riding motorcycles religiously for about ten years and commuting daily up and down the all-too-congested &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=San+Francisco,+CA+to+San+Jose,+CA&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=10&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Highway 101 in the San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; for about five of those years, day or night, rain or shine.

            <column name="post_content">&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;According to the California Highway Patrol website, &quot;lane splitting by motorcycles is permissible but must be done in a safe and prudent manner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Terms like &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot; are rather vague, but most experienced motorcyclists will tell you that a top speed of roughly 35-40mph and a speed differential (or &lt;em&gt;delta&lt;/em&gt;, the difference in speed between you and the rest of traffic) of 10-15 mph is what they generally live by when lane-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;That's not to say that you can &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; safely overtake a car at 50mph, or that it's &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; safe to overtake a car at 15mph. There are countless variables involved in making a decision to safely split past an automobile: weather, road conditions, and time of day are three of the biggest. As the one and only person responsible for your safety on a motorcycle, ultimately it's up to you to judge whether or not it's safe to split, and at what speed you're going to be safe doing it for a given set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wackyiraqi.com/moto/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/correct.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-593&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;&quot; title=&quot;correct&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wackyiraqi.com/moto/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/correct-192x300.gif&quot; alt=&quot;correct&quot; width=&quot;192&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Most new riders start out a bit slow and wobbly, even more so when they're lane-sharing, so it's important to keep your speed down at first. Eventually, you'll get faster and more smooth, but there's a limit to everything. There is a maximum speed at which no rider can react fast enough to being cut off--at that point your maximum speed has little do with your skill level, and much to do with the amount of risk you're willing to accept. In other words, splitting through 5mph traffic at 70 is a game of chance, and relying on lady luck instead of your skills is never a good idea on a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Lane-sharing on a freeway is generally done in the very right portion of the #1 lane (the far left &quot;fast&quot; lane). Splitting other lanes is not illegal, but the farther right you move the more likely and often cars are going to changing lanes to enter and exit the highway. Splitting between the #2 and #3 lanes is generally considered bad form, because those those drivers in the #2 lane who see you coming and are considerate enough to move left out of your way will be moving right into the path of any motorcyclists in the more typical #1 lane. I'll talk more about this when I eventually get to the topic of passing slower riders in the split.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to pissing off all the drivers around you, you're likely to get popped with an unsafe lane change ticket (CVC 21658&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;by your friendly neighborhood CHP officer.&lt;/p&gt;

As the one and only person responsible for your safety on a motorcycle, ultimately it's up to you to judge whether or not it's safe to split, and at what speed you're going to be safe doing it for a given set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Most new riders start out a bit slow and wobbly, even more so when they're lane-sharing, so it's important to keep your speed down at first. Eventually, you'll get faster and more smooth, but there's a limit to everything. There is a maximum speed at which no rider can react fast enough to being cut off--at that point your maximum speed has little do with your skill level, and much to do with the amount of risk you're willing to accept. In other words, splitting through 5mph traffic at 70 is a game of chance, and relying on lady luck instead of your skills is never a good idea on a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;

            <column name="post_content">&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;According to the California Highway Patrol website, &quot;lane splitting by motorcycles is permissible but must be done in a safe and prudent manner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Terms like &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot; are rather vague, but most experienced motorcyclists will tell you that a top speed of roughly 35-40mph and a speed differential (or &lt;em&gt;delta&lt;/em&gt;, the difference in speed between you and the rest of traffic) of 10-15 mph is what they generally live by when lane-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;That's not to say that you can &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; safely overtake a car at 50mph, or that it's &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; safe to overtake a car at 15mph.

&lt;/style&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt;Lane-sharing (lane-splitting, filtering, white-lining, etc.) is currently legal in one and only state in the US: California. It's a crying shame, really, as it's not only legal but exceedingly common in just about every other country on the planet.&lt;em&gt;But it's so dangerous! Right?!&lt;/em&gt;

Not exactly, no.

According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurt_Report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hurt Report&lt;/a&gt;, the reigning bible of motorcycle crash statistics, the risk to a rider of being hit while lane-sharing is actually &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt;than the risk of being hit while sitting in traffic with the drooling, four-wheeled masses. This is largely due to the relatively good chance of being rear-ended in stop-and-go traffic, coupled with the increased attention levels required of riders to lane-share.

With those initial few facts out of the way, and before I get into any specific tips on lane-sharing, let me first fire out this big disclaimer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm neither a teacher nor a certified instructor. I'm not an expert, per se; I don't have any fancy certificates on my wall and I've never taught any sort of organized class on motorcycling (or anything, really.)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;What I'll be typing are my opinions--information, tips and techniques that I've picked up from my own experiences and those I've learned from other riders over the yearsâ€”nothing more.

I have been riding motorcycles religiously for about ten years and commuting daily up and down the all-too-congested &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=San+Francisco,+CA+to+San+Jose,+CA&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=10&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Highway 101 in the San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; for about five of those years, day or night, rain or shine. As one might imagine, I have more lane-sharing miles under my belt than many riders have &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; miles. Still, you should take everything I say here with a large grain of salt, as you should the advice of any random motorcyclist who tries to dole it out unsolicited.

Don't ever do anything on a motorcycle with which you're not 110% comfortable. Don't ride above your abilities. Don't believe everything you read on the internet. If it seems like a bad idea, it probably is. Never stop learning. Your mileage may vary. Void where prohibited by law. Need not be present to win. Donâ€™t chop down cherry trees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be posting some thoughts (and pretty pictures!) that will hopefully help you become a safer, more confident lane-sharererer-erer. If you don't currently split lanes, hopefully I'll be able to give you a tiny bit of knowledge and help you start slowly, carefully and safely, to live in a world without traffic jams.

            <column name="post_content">&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;According to the California Highway Patrol website, &quot;lane splitting by motorcycles is permissible but must be done in a safe and prudent manner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Terms like &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot; are rather vague, but most experienced motorcyclists will tell you that a top speed of roughly 35-40mph and a speed differential (or &lt;em&gt;delta&lt;/em&gt;, the difference in speed between you and the rest of traffic) of 10-15 mph is what they generally live by when lane-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;That's not to say that you can &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; safely overtake a car at 50mph, or that it's &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; safe to overtake a car at 15mph. There are countless variables involved in making a decision to safely split past an automobile: weather, road conditions, and time of day are three of the biggest. As the one and only person responsible for your safety on a motorcycle, ultimately it's up to you to judge whether or not it's safe to split, and at what speed you're going to be safe doing it for a given set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Most new riders start out a bit slow and wobbly, even more so when they're lane-sharing, so it's important to keep your speed down at first. Eventually, you'll get faster and more smooth, but there's a limit to everything. There is a maximum speed at which no rider can react fast enough to being cut off--at that point your maximum speed has little do with your skill level, and much to do with the amount of risk you're willing to accept. In other words, splitting through 5mph traffic at 70 is a game of chance, and relying on lady luck instead of your skills is never a good idea on a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to pissing off all the drivers around you, you're likely to get popped with an unsafe lane change ticket (CVC 21658&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;by your friendly neighborhood CHP officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Terms like &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot; are rather vague, but most experienced motorcyclists will tell you that a top speed of roughly 35-40mph and a speed differential (or &lt;em&gt;delta&lt;/em&gt;, the difference in speed between you and the rest of traffic) of 10-15 mph is what they generally live by when lane-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;That's not to say that you can &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; safely overtake a car at 50mph, or that it's &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; safe to overtake a car at 15mph. There are countless variables involved in making a decision to safely split past an automobile: weather, road conditions, and time of day are three of the biggest. As the one and only person responsible for your safety on a motorcycle, ultimately it's up to you to judge whether or not it's safe to split, and at what speed you're going to be safe doing it for a given set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Most new riders start out a bit slow and wobbly, even more so when they're lane-sharing, so it's important to keep your speed down at first. Eventually, you'll get faster and more smooth, but there's a limit to everything. There is a maximum speed at which no rider can react fast enough to being cut off--at that point your maximum speed has little do with your skill level, and much to do with the amount of risk you're willing to accept. In other words, splitting through 5mph traffic at 70 is a game of chance, and relying on lady luck instead of your skills is never a good idea on a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;

Splitting other lanes is not illegal, but the farther right you move the more likely and often cars are going to changing lanes to enter and exit the highway. Splitting between the #2 and #3 lanes is generally considered bad form, because those those drivers in the #2 lane who see you coming and are considerate enough to move left out of your way will be moving right into the path of any motorcyclists in the more typical #1 lane. I'll talk more about this when I eventually get to the topic of passing slower riders in the split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Occasionally, you'll need to cross into the #2 lane to sneak around a particularly wide vehicle or one that that's positioned in the right half of the #1 lane, but constantly jumping back and forth between lanes is sloppy, dangerous, and illegal. In addition to pissing off all the drivers around you, you're likely to get popped with an unsafe lane change ticket (CVC 21658&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;by your friendly neighborhood CHP officer.&lt;/p&gt;

He exhibited all the signs of a newbie with little to no experience lane splitting in heavy commute traffic: He was agonizingly slow. He continually jumped over the line between the #1 to #2 lanes (something that'll earn a rider a fat ticket). He was reluctant to split past cars when he had &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of space. He braked hard and often, then accelerated through dangerous gaps in traffic, where cars tend to jump lanes and hit motorcycles with no warning.

At this point, you're probably wondering why I didn't just move two lanes over and pass the guy and speed off into the split like any normal rider would do when confronted with a rolling road-hazard like that. That's the rub--the rider was a CHP officer, on-duty, riding his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wackyiraqi.com/moto/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/rtp-my.jpg&quot;&gt;R1150-RTP&lt;/a&gt; like a 4 year-old on his first bicycle.

The best part of the whole debacle? I arrived home, and stepped off my bike to this message on my phone from a friend who evidently saw us both pass from his car:

Really don't know how to split lanes do they??? lol
