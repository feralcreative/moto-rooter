# Windsurf/Cascade Instructions

## General

- Be skeptical of your own fixes and code suggestions. Don't give them with unwarranted confidenceâ€”you are fallible and frequently wrong.
- Do not add any new files without my explicit permission. If a given script or function is needed, it may already exist and you just can't see it.
- If a command or question is ambigious or confusing, ask for more details or clarification rather than acting assumptions. Make no assumptions, ever.
- When you give code snippets/fixes, be sure to explictly state which file it should be applied to

## File Management

- DO NOT create new files unless explicitly requested
- Assume any required functions/scripts may already exist elsewhere in the codebase
- Work with existing files only unless given permission otherwise

## Debugging

- When analyzing large log files, prioritize searching for:
  - `error`
  - `warning`
  - `failed`
  - `exception`
  - `crash`
- Focus on context surrounding these keywords to identify root causes
- For deployment issues, check container health and port binding configurations first

### Best Practices

- Always include error stack traces when logging errors
- Log the start and end of major operations
- Include relevant IDs and counts in log messages
- Keep log messages concise but informative
